       "[\"It was a perfect sunny summer afternoon in Copenhagen when the world’s largest shipping conglomerate began to lose its mind. The headquarters of A.P. Møller-Maersk sits beside the breezy, cobblestoned esplanade of Copenhagen’s harbor. A ship’s mast carrying the Danish flag is planted by the building’s northeastern corner, and six stories of blue-tinted windows look out over the water, facing a dock where the Danish royal family parks its yacht. In the building’s basement, employees can browse a corporate gift shop, stocked with Maersk-branded bags and ties, and even a rare Lego model of the company’s gargantuan Triple-E container ship, a vessel roughly as large as the Empire State Building laid on its side, capable of carrying another Empire State Building–sized load of cargo stacked on top of it. That gift shop also houses a technology help center, a single desk manned by IT troubleshooters next to the shop’s cashier. And on the afternoon of June 27, 2017, confused Maersk staffers began to gather at that help desk in twos and threes, almost all of them carrying laptops. On the machines’ screens were messages in red and black lettering. Some read “repairing file system on C:” with a stark warning not to turn off the computer. Others, more surreally, read “oops, your important files are encrypted” and demanded a payment of $300 worth of bitcoin to decrypt them. September 2018. Subscribe to WIRED. Mike McQuade Across the street, an IT administrator named Henrik Jensen was working in another part of the Maersk compound, an ornate white-stone building that in previous centuries had served as the royal archive of maritime maps and charts. (Henrik Jensen is not his real name. Like almost every Maersk employee, customer, or partner I interviewed, Jensen feared the consequences of speaking publicly for this story.) Jensen was busy preparing a software update for Maersk’s nearly 80,000 employees when his computer spontaneously restarted. He quietly swore under his breath. Jensen assumed the unplanned reboot was a typically brusque move by Maersk’s central IT department, a little-loved entity in England that oversaw most of the corporate empire, whose eight business units ranged from ports to logistics to oil drilling, in 574 offices in 130 countries around the globe. Jensen looked up to ask if anyone else in his open-plan office of IT staffers had been so rudely interrupted. And as he craned his head, he watched every other computer screen around the room blink out in rapid succession. “I saw a wave of screens turning black. Black, black, black. Black black black black black,” he says. The PCs, Jensen and his neighbors quickly discovered, were irreversibly locked. Restarting only returned them to the same black screen. About the Author Andy Greenberg (@a_greenberg) is a WIRED senior writer. This story is excerpted from his book Sandworm, forthcoming from Doubleday. All across Maersk headquarters, the full scale of the crisis was starting to become clear. Within half an hour, Maersk employees were running down hallways, yelling to their colleagues to turn off computers or disconnect them from Maersk’s network before the malicious software could infect them, as it dawned on them that every minute could mean dozens or hundreds more corrupted PCs. Tech workers ran into conference rooms and unplugged machines in the middle of meetings. Soon staffers were hurdling over locked key-card gates, which had been paralyzed by the still-mysterious malware, to spread the warning to other sections of the building. Disconnecting Maersk’s entire global network took the company’s IT staff more than two panicky hours. By the end of that process, every employee had been ordered to turn off their computer and leave it at their desk. The digital phones at every cubicle, too, had been rendered useless in the emergency network shutdown. Around 3 pm, a Maersk executive walked into the room where Jensen and a dozen or so of his colleagues were anxiously awaiting news and told them to go home. Maersk’s network was so deeply corrupted that even IT staffers were helpless. A few of the company’s more old-school managers told their teams to remain at the office. But many employees—rendered entirely idle without computers, servers, routers, or desk phones—simply left. Jensen walked out of the building and into the warm air of a late June afternoon. Like the vast majority of Maersk staffers, he had no idea when he might return to work. The maritime giant that employed him, responsible for 76 ports on all sides of the earth and nearly 800 seafaring vessels, including container ships carrying tens of millions of tons of cargo, representing close to a fifth of the entire world’s shipping capacity, was dead in the water. Mike Mcquade\\n\\nOn the edge of the trendy Podil neighborhood in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, coffee shops and parks abruptly evaporate, replaced by a grim industrial landscape. Under a highway overpass, across some trash-strewn railroad tracks, and through a concrete gate stands the four-story headquarters of Linkos Group, a small, family-run Ukrainian software business. Up three flights of stairs in that building is a server room, where a rack of \\xadpizza-box-sized computers is connected by a tangle of wires and marked with handwritten, numbered labels. On a normal day, these servers push out routine updates—bug fixes, security patches, new features—to a piece of accounting software called M.E.Doc, which is more or less Ukraine’s equivalent of TurboTax or Quicken. It’s used by nearly anyone who files taxes or does business in the country. But for a moment in 2017, those machines served as ground zero for the most devastating cyberattack since the invention of the internet—an attack that began, at least, as an assault on one nation by another. For the past four and a half years, Ukraine has been locked in a grinding, undeclared war with Russia that has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainians and displaced millions more. The conflict has also seen Ukraine become a scorched-earth testing ground for Russian cyberwar tactics. In 2015 and 2016, while the Kremlin-linked hackers known as Fancy Bear were busy breaking into the US Democratic National Committee’s servers, another group of agents known as Sandworm was hacking into dozens of Ukrainian governmental organizations and companies. They penetrated the networks of victims ranging from media outlets to railway firms, detonating logic bombs that destroyed terabytes of data. The attacks followed a sadistic seasonal cadence. In the winters of both years, the saboteurs capped off their destructive sprees by causing widespread power outages—the first confirmed blackouts induced by hackers. But those attacks still weren’t Sandworm’s grand finale. In the spring of 2017, unbeknownst to anyone at Linkos Group, Russian military hackers hijacked the company’s update servers to allow them a hidden back door into the thousands of PCs around the country and the world that have M.E.Doc installed. Then, in June 2017, the saboteurs used that back door to release a piece of malware called \\xadNotPetya, their most vicious cyberweapon yet. Related Stories How An Entire Nation Became Russia's Test Lab for Cyberwar\\n\\nFacebook's Mandatory Malware Scan Is an Intrusive Mess\\n\\nInside the Takedown of a Notorious Malware Clearinghouse The code that the hackers pushed out was honed to spread automatically, rapidly, and indiscriminately. “To date, it was simply the fastest-propagating piece of malware we’ve ever seen,” says Craig Williams, director of outreach at Cisco’s Talos division, one of the first security companies to reverse engineer and analyze Not\\xadPetya. “By the second you saw it, your data center was already gone.” NotPetya was propelled by two powerful hacker exploits working in tandem: One was a penetration tool known as EternalBlue, created by the US National Security Agency but leaked in a disastrous breach of the agency’s ultrasecret files earlier in 2017. EternalBlue takes advantage of a vulnerability in a particular Windows protocol, allowing hackers free rein to remotely run their own code on any unpatched machine. NotPetya’s architects combined that digital skeleton key with an older invention known as Mimikatz, created as a proof of concept by French security researcher Benjamin Delpy in 2011. Delpy had originally released Mimikatz to demonstrate that Windows left users’ passwords lingering in computers’ memory. Once hackers gained initial access to a computer, Mimikatz could pull those passwords out of RAM and use them to hack into other machines accessible with the same credentials. On networks with multiuser computers, it could even allow an automated attack to hopscotch from one machine to the next. Before NotPetya’s launch, Microsoft had released a patch for its EternalBlue vulnerability. But EternalBlue and Mimikatz together nonetheless made a virulent combination. “You can infect computers that aren’t patched, and then you can grab the passwords from those computers to infect other computers that are patched,” Delpy says. NotPetya took its name from its resemblance to the ransomware Petya, a piece of criminal code that surfaced in early 2016 and extorted victims to pay for a key to unlock their files. But NotPetya’s ransom messages were only a ruse: The malware’s goal was purely destructive. It irreversibly encrypted computers’ master boot records, the deep-seated part of a machine that tells it where to find its own operating system. Any ransom payment that victims tried to make was futile. No key even existed to reorder the scrambled noise of their computer’s contents. The weapon’s target was Ukraine. But its blast radius was the entire world. “It was the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory,” Bossert says. The release of NotPetya was an act of cyberwar by almost any definition—one that was likely more explosive than even its creators intended. Within hours of its first appearance, the worm raced beyond Ukraine and out to countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate factory in Tasmania. It \\xadcrippled multinational companies including Maersk, pharmaceutical giant Merck, FedEx’s European subsidiary TNT Express, French construction company Saint-Gobain, food producer Mondelēz, and manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser. In each case, it inflicted nine-figure costs. It even spread back to Russia, striking the state oil company Rosneft. The result was more than $10 billion in total damages, according to a White House assessment confirmed to WIRED by former Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert, who at the time of the attack was President Trump’s most senior cybersecurity-\\xadfocused official. Bossert and US intelligence agencies also confirmed in February that Russia’s military—the prime suspect in any cyberwar attack targeting Ukraine—was responsible for launching the malicious code. (The Russian foreign ministry declined to answer repeated requests for comment.) To get a sense of the scale of NotPetya’s damage, consider the nightmarish but more typical ransomware attack that paralyzed the city government of Atlanta this past March: It cost up to $10 million, a tenth of a percent of NotPetya’s price. Even WannaCry, the more notorious worm that spread a month before NotPetya in May 2017, is estimated to have cost between $4 billion and $8 billion. Nothing since has come close. “While there was no loss of life, it was the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory,” Bossert says. “That’s a degree of recklessness we can’t tolerate on the world stage.” In the year since NotPetya shook the world, WIRED has delved into the experience of one corporate goliath brought to its knees by Russia’s worm: Maersk, whose malware fiasco uniquely demonstrates the danger that cyberwar now poses to the infrastructure of the modern world. The executives of the shipping behemoth, like every other non-Ukrainian victim WIRED approached to speak about NotPetya, declined to comment in any official capacity for this story. WIRED’s account is instead assembled from current and former Maersk sources, many of whom chose to remain anonymous. But the story of NotPetya isn’t truly about Maersk, or even about Ukraine. It’s the story of a nation-state’s weapon of war released in a medium where national borders have no meaning, and where collateral damage travels via a cruel and unexpected logic: Where an attack aimed at Ukraine strikes Maersk, and an attack on Maersk strikes everywhere at once.\\n\\nOleksii Yasinsky expected a calm Tuesday at the office. It was the day before Ukraine’s Constitution Day, a national holiday, and most of his coworkers were either planning their vacations or already taking them. But not Yasinsky. For the past year he’d been the head of the cyber lab at Information Systems Security Partners, a company that was quickly becoming the go-to firm for victims of Ukraine’s cyberwar. That job description didn’t lend itself to downtime. Since the first blows of Russia’s cyberattacks hit in late 2015, in fact, he’d allowed himself a grand total of one week off. So Yasinsky was unperturbed when he received a call that morning from ISSP’s director telling him that Oschadbank, the second-largest bank in Ukraine, was under attack. The bank had told ISSP that it was facing a ransomware infection, an increasingly common crisis for companies around the world targeted by profit-focused cybercriminals. But when Yasinsky walked into Oschadbank’s IT department at its central Kiev office half an hour later, he could tell this was something new. “The staff were lost, confused, in a state of shock,” Yasinsky says. Around 90 percent of the bank’s thousands of computers were locked, showing NotPetya’s “repairing disk” messages and ransom screens. After a quick examination of the bank’s surviving logs, Yasinsky could see that the attack was an automated worm that had somehow obtained an administrator’s credentials. That had allowed it to rampage through the bank’s network like a prison inmate who has stolen the warden’s keys. As he analyzed the bank’s breach back in ISSP’s office, Yasinsky started receiving calls and messages from people around Ukraine, telling him of similar instances in other companies and government agencies. One told him that another victim had attempted to pay the ransom. As Yasinsky suspected, the payment had no effect. This was no ordinary ransomware. “There was no silver bullet for this, no antidote,” he says. The Cost of NotPetya In 2017, the malware NotPetya spread from the servers of an unassuming Ukrainian software firm to some of the largest businesses worldwide, paralyzing their operations. Here’s a list of the approximate damages reported by some of the worm’s biggest victims. $870,000,000 Pharmaceutical company Merck $400,000,000 Delivery company FedEx (through European subsidiary TNT Express) $384,000,000 French construction company Saint-Gobain $300,000,000 Danish shipping company Maersk $188,000,000 Snack company Mondelēz (parent company of Nabisco and Cadbury) $129,000,000 British manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser (owner of Lysol and Durex condoms) $10 billion Total damages from NotPetya, as estimated by the White House A thousand miles to the south, ISSP CEO Roman Sologub was attempting to take a Constitution Day vacation on the southern coast of Turkey, preparing to head to the beach with his family. His phone, too, began to explode with calls from ISSP clients who were either watching NotPetya tear across their networks or reading news of the attack and frantically seeking advice. Sologub retreated to his hotel, where he’d spend the rest of the day fielding more than 50 calls from customers reporting, one after another after another, that their networks had been infected. ISSP’s security operations center, which monitored the networks of clients in real time, warned Sologub that NotPetya was saturating victims’ systems with terrifying speed: It took 45 seconds to bring down the network of a large Ukrainian bank. A portion of one major Ukrainian transit hub, where ISSP had installed its equipment as a demonstration, was fully infected in 16 seconds. Ukrenergo, the energy company whose network ISSP had been helping to rebuild after the 2016 blackout cyberattack, had also been struck yet again. “Do you remember we were about to implement new security controls?” Sologub recalls a frustrated Ukrenergo IT director asking him on the phone. “Well, too late.” By noon, ISSP’s founder, a serial entrepreneur named Oleh Derevianko, had sidelined his vacation too. Derevianko was driving north to meet his family at his village house for the holiday when the NotPetya calls began. Soon he had pulled off the highway and was working from a roadside restaurant. By the early afternoon, he was warning every executive who called to unplug their networks without hesitation, even if it meant shutting down their entire company. In many cases, they’d already waited too long. “By the time you reached them, the infrastructure was already lost,” Derevianko says. On a national scale, NotPetya was eating Ukraine’s computers alive. It would hit at least four hospitals in Kiev alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency. “The government was dead,” summarizes Ukrainian minister of infrastructure Volodymyr Omelyan. According to ISSP, at least 300 companies were hit, and one senior Ukrainian government official estimated that 10 percent of all computers in the country were wiped. The attack even shut down the computers used by scientists at the Chernobyl cleanup site, 60 miles north of Kiev. “It was a massive bombing of all our systems,” Omelyan says. When Derevianko emerged from the restaurant in the early evening, he stopped to refuel his car and found that the gas station’s credit card payment system had been taken out by NotPetya too. With no cash in his pockets, he eyed his gas gauge, wondering if he had enough fuel to reach his village. Across the country, Ukrainians were asking themselves similar questions: whether they had enough money for groceries and gas to last through the blitz, whether they would receive their paychecks and pensions, whether their prescriptions would be filled. By that night, as the outside world was still debating whether NotPetya was criminal ransom\\xadware or a weapon of state-sponsored cyberwar, ISSP’s staff had already started referring to it as a new kind of phenomenon: a “massive, coordinated cyber invasion.” Amid that epidemic, one single infection would become particularly fateful for Maersk: In an office in Odessa, a port city on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, a finance executive for Maersk’s Ukraine operation had asked IT administrators to install the accounting software M.E.Doc on a single computer. That gave NotPetya the only foothold it needed.\\n\\nThe shipping terminal in Elizabeth, New Jersey—one of the 76 that make up the port-operations division of Maersk known as APM Terminals—sprawls out into Newark Bay on a man-made peninsula covering a full square mile. Tens of thousands of stacked, perfectly modular shipping containers cover its vast asphalt landscape, and 200-foot-high blue cranes loom over the bay. From the top floors of lower Manhattan’s skyscrapers, five miles away, they look like brachiosaurs gathered at a Jurassic-era watering hole. On a good day, about 3,000 trucks arrive at the terminal, each assigned to pick up or drop off tens of thousands of pounds of everything from diapers to avocados to tractor parts. They start that process, much like airline passengers, by checking in at the terminal’s gate, where scanners automatically read their container’s barcodes and a Maersk gate clerk talks to the truck driver via a speaker system. The driver receives a printed pass that tells them where to park so that a massive yard crane can haul their container from the truck’s chassis to a stack in the cargo yard, where it’s loaded onto a container ship and floated across an ocean—or that entire process in reverse order. On the morning of June 27, Pablo Fernández was expecting dozens of trucks’ worth of cargo to be shipped out from Elizabeth to a port in the Middle East. Fernández is a so-called freight forwarder—a middleman whom cargo owners pay to make sure their property arrives safely at a destination halfway around the world. (Fernández is not his real name.) At around 9 am New Jersey time, Fernández’s phone started buzzing with a succession of screaming calls from angry cargo owners. All of them had just heard from truck drivers that their vehicles were stuck outside Maersk’s Elizabeth terminal. “People were jumping up and down,” Fernández says. “They couldn’t get their containers in and out of the gate.” That gate, a choke point to Maersk’s entire New Jersey terminal operation, was dead. The gate clerks had gone silent. Soon, hundreds of 18-wheelers were backed up in a line that stretched for miles outside the terminal. One employee at another company’s nearby terminal at the same New Jersey port watched the trucks collect, bumper to bumper, farther than he could see. He’d seen gate systems go down for stretches of 15 minutes or half an hour before. But after a few hours, still with no word from Maersk, the Port Authority put out an alert that the company’s Elizabeth terminal would be closed for the rest of the day. “That’s when we started to realize,” the nearby terminal’s staffer remembers, “this was an attack.” Police began to approach drivers in their cabs, telling them to turn their massive loads around and clear out. Fernández and countless other frantic Maersk customers faced a set of bleak options: They could try to get their precious cargo onto other ships at premium, last-minute rates, often traveling the equivalent of standby. Or, if their cargo was part of a tight supply chain, like components for a factory, Maersk’s outage could mean shelling out for exorbitant air freight delivery or risk stalling manufacturing processes, where a single day of downtime costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of the containers, known as reefers, were electrified and full of perishable goods that required refrigeration. They’d have to be plugged in somewhere or their contents would rot. Fernández had to scramble to find a New Jersey warehouse where he could stash his customers’ cargo while he waited for word from Maersk. During the entire first day, he says, he received only one official email, which read like “gibberish,” from a frazzled Maersk staffer’s Gmail account, offering no real explanation of the mounting crisis. The company’s central booking website, Maerskline.com, was down, and no one at the company was picking up their phones. Some of the containers he’d sent on Maersk’s ships that day would remain lost in cargo yards and ports around the world for the next three months. “Maersk was like a black hole,” Fernández remembers with a sigh. “It was just a clusterfuck.” In fact, it was a clusterfuck of clusterfucks. The same scene was playing out at 17 of Maersk’s 76 terminals, from Los Angeles to Algeciras, Spain, to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, to Mumbai. Gates were down. Cranes were frozen. Tens of thousands of trucks would be turned away from comatose terminals across the globe. No new bookings could be made, essentially cutting off Maersk’s core source of shipping revenue. The computers on Maersk’s ships weren’t infected. But the terminals’ software, designed to receive the Electronic Data Interchange files from those ships, which tell terminal operators the exact contents of their massive cargo holds, had been entirely wiped away. That left Maersk’s ports with no guide to perform the colossal Jenga game of loading and unloading their towering piles of containers. For days to come, one of the world’s most complex and interconnected distributed machines, underpinning the circulatory system of the global economy itself, would remain broken. “It was clear this problem was of a magnitude never seen before in global transport,” one Maersk customer remembers. “In the history of shipping IT, no one has ever gone through such a monumental crisis.” Mike McQuade\\n\\nSeveral days after his screen had gone dark in a corner of Maersk’s office, Henrik Jensen was at home in his Copenhagen apartment, enjoying a brunch of poached eggs, toast, and marmalade. Since he’d walked out of the office the Tuesday before, he hadn’t heard a word from any of his superiors. Then his phone rang. When he answered, he found himself on a conference call with three Maersk staffers. He was needed, they said, at Maersk’s office in Maidenhead, England, a town west of London where the conglomerate’s IT overlords, Maersk Group Infrastructure Services, were based. They told him to drop everything and go there. Immediately. Two hours later, Jensen was on a plane to London, then in a car to an eight-story glass-and-brick building in central Maidenhead. When he arrived, he found that the fourth and fifth floors of the building had been converted into a 24/7 emergency operations center. Its singular purpose: to rebuild Maersk’s global network in the wake of its NotPetya meltdown. Some Maersk staffers, Jensen learned, had been in the recovery center since Tuesday, when NotPetya first struck. Some had been sleeping in the office, under their desks or in corners of conference rooms. Others seemed to be arriving every minute from other parts of the world, luggage in hand. Maersk had booked practically every hotel room within tens of miles, every bed-and-breakfast, every spare room above a pub. Staffers were subsisting on snacks that someone had piled up in the office kitchen after a trip to a nearby Sainsbury’s grocery store. The Maidenhead recovery center was being managed by the consultancy Deloitte. Maersk had essentially given the UK firm a blank check to make its NotPetya problem go away, and at any given time as many as 200 Deloitte staffers were stationed in the Maidenhead office, alongside up to 400 Maersk personnel. All computer equipment used by Maersk from before NotPetya’s outbreak had been confiscated, for fear that it might infect new systems, and signs were posted threatening disciplinary action against anyone who used it. Instead, staffers had gone into every available electronics store in Maidenhead and bought up piles of new laptops and prepaid Wi-Fi hot spots. Jensen, like hundreds of other Maersk IT staffers, was given one of those fresh laptops and told to do his job. “It was very much just ‘Find your corner, get to work, do whatever needs to be done,’ ” he says. Early in the operation, the IT staffers rebuilding Maersk’s network came to a sickening realization. They had located backups of almost all of Maersk’s individual servers, dating from between three and seven days prior to NotPetya’s onset. But no one could find a backup for one crucial layer of the company’s network: its domain controllers, the servers that function as a detailed map of Maersk’s network and set the basic rules that determine which users are allowed access to which systems. Maersk’s 150 or so domain controllers were programmed to sync their data with one another, so that, in theory, any of them could function as a backup for all the others. But that decentralized backup strategy hadn’t accounted for one scenario: where every domain controller is wiped simultaneously. “If we can’t recover our domain controllers,” a Maersk IT staffer remembers thinking, “we can’t recover anything.” After a frantic global search, the admins finally found one lone surviving domain controller in a remote office—in Ghana. After a frantic search that entailed calling hundreds of IT admins in data centers around the world, Maersk’s desperate administrators finally found one lone surviving domain controller in a remote office—in Ghana. At some point before NotPetya struck, a blackout had knocked the Ghanaian machine offline, and the computer remained disconnected from the network. It thus contained the singular known copy of the company’s domain controller data left untouched by the malware—all thanks to a power outage. “There were a lot of joyous whoops in the office when we found it,” a Maersk administrator says. When the tense engineers in Maidenhead set up a connection to the Ghana office, however, they found its bandwidth was so thin that it would take days to transmit the several-hundred-gigabyte domain controller backup to the UK. Their next idea: put a Ghanaian staffer on the next plane to London. But none of the West African office’s employees had a British visa. So the Maidenhead operation arranged for a kind of relay race: One staffer from the Ghana office flew to Nigeria to meet another Maersk employee in the airport to hand off the very precious hard drive. That staffer then boarded the six-and-a-half-hour flight to Heathrow, carrying the keystone of Maersk’s entire recovery process. With that rescue operation completed, the Maidenhead office could begin bringing Maersk’s core services back online. After the first days, Maersk’s port operations had regained the ability to read the ships’ inventory files, so operators were no longer blind to the contents of the hulking, 18,000-container vessels arriving in their harbors. But several days would pass after the initial outage before Maersk started taking orders through Maerskline.com for new shipments, and it would be more than a week before terminals around the world started functioning with any degree of normalcy. In the meantime, Maersk staffers worked with whatever tools were still available to them. They taped paper documents to shipping containers at APM ports and took orders via personal Gmail accounts, WhatsApp, and Excel spreadsheets. “I can tell you it’s a fairly bizarre experience to find yourself booking 500 shipping containers via WhatsApp, but that’s what we did,” one Maersk customer says. About two weeks after the attack, Maersk’s network had finally reached a point where the company could begin reissuing personal computers to the majority of staff. Back at the Copenhagen headquarters, a cafeteria in the basement of the building was turned into a reinstallation assembly line. Computers were lined up 20 at a time on dining tables as help desk staff walked down the rows, inserting USB drives they’d copied by the dozens, clicking through prompts for hours. A few days after his return from Maidenhead, Henrik Jensen found his laptop in an alphabetized pile of hundreds, its hard drive wiped, a clean image of Windows installed. Everything that he and every other Maersk employee had stored locally on their machines, from notes to contacts to family photos, was gone.\\n\\nFive months after Maersk had recovered from its NotPetya attack, Maersk chair Jim Hagemann Snabe sat onstage at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, and lauded the “heroic effort” that went into the company’s IT rescue operation. From June 27, when he was first awakened by a 4 am phone call in California, ahead of a planned appearance at a Stanford conference, he said, it took just 10 days for the company to rebuild its entire network of 4,000 servers and 45,000 PCs. (Full recovery had taken far longer: Some staffers at the Maidenhead operation continued to work day and night for close to two months to rebuild Maersk’s software setup.) “We overcame the problem with human resilience,” Snabe told the crowd. Since then, Snabe went on, Maersk has worked not only to improve its cybersecurity but also to make it a “competitive advantage.” Indeed, in the wake of NotPetya, IT staffers say that practically every security feature they’ve asked for has been almost immediately approved. Multifactor authentication has been rolled out across the company, along with a long-delayed upgrade to Windows 10. Snabe, however, didn’t say much about the company’s security posture pre-NotPetya. Maersk security staffers tell WIRED that some of the corporation’s servers were, up until the attack, still running Windows 2000—an operating system so old Microsoft no longer supported it. In 2016, one group of IT executives had pushed for a preemptive security redesign of Maersk’s entire global network. They called attention to Maersk’s less-than-perfect software patching, outdated operating systems, and above all insufficient network segmentation. That last vulnerability in particular, they warned, could allow malware with access to one part of the network to spread wildly beyond its initial foothold, exactly as NotPetya would the next year. The security revamp was green-lit and budgeted. But its success was never made a so-called key performance indicator for Maersk’s most senior IT overseers, so implementing it wouldn’t contribute to their bonuses. They never carried the security makeover forward. Few firms have paid more dearly for dragging their feet on security. In his Davos talk, Snabe claimed that the company suffered only a 20 percent reduction in total shipping volume during its NotPetya outage, thanks to its quick efforts and manual workarounds. But aside from the company’s lost business and downtime, as well as the cost of rebuilding an entire network, Maersk also reimbursed many of its customers for the expense of rerouting or storing their marooned cargo. One Maersk customer described receiving a seven-figure check from the company to cover the cost of sending his cargo via last-minute chartered jet. “They paid me a cool million with no more than a two-minute discussion,” he says. On top of the panic and disruption it caused, NotPetya may have wiped away evidence of espionage or even reconnaissance for future sabotage. All told, Snabe estimated in his Davos comments, NotPetya cost Maersk between $250 million and $300 million. Most of the staffers WIRED spoke with privately suspected the company’s accountants had low-balled the figure. Regardless, those numbers only start to describe the magnitude of the damage. Logistics companies whose livelihoods depend on Maersk-owned terminals weren’t all treated as well during the outage as Maersk’s customers, for instance. Jeffrey Bader, president of a Port Newark–based trucking group, the Association of Bi-State Motor Carriers, estimates that the unreimbursed cost for trucking companies and truckers alone is in the tens of millions. “It was a nightmare,” Bader says. “We lost a lot of money, and we’re angry.” The wider cost of Maersk’s disruption to the global supply chain as a whole—which depends on just-in-time delivery of products and manufacturing components—is far harder to measure. And, of course, Maersk was only one victim. Merck, whose ability to manufacture some drugs was temporarily shut down by NotPetya, told shareholders it lost a staggering $870 million due to the malware. FedEx, whose European subsidiary TNT Express was crippled in the attack and required months to recover some data, took a $400 million blow. French construction giant Saint-Gobain lost around the same amount. Reckitt Benckiser, the British manufacturer of Durex condoms, lost $129 million, and Mondelēz, the owner of chocolate-maker Cadbury, took a $188 million hit. Untold numbers of victims without public shareholders counted their losses in secret. Only when you start to multiply Maersk’s story—imagining the same paralysis, the same serial crises, the same grueling recovery—playing out across dozens of other NotPetya victims and countless other industries does the true scale of Russia’s cyberwar crime begin to come into focus. “This was a very significant wake-up call,” Snabe said at his Davos panel. Then he added, with a Scandinavian touch of understatement, “You could say, a very expensive one.”\",\n",
       " \"Of all the cars humanity has produced in the past century, few are better loved than the Porsche 911. Elegant, accessible, a thrill to drive, and ever evolving, the car that debuted in 1964 has earned its fanatics. Which makes it jarring to hear what happened when the team at Williams Advanced Engineering stuck one in its virtual wind tunnel.\\n\\n“It was catastrophic,” says Mazen Fawaz, the CEO of Singer Vehicle Design.\\n\\nLos Angeles-based Singer specializes in restoring and occasionally rethinking various versions of the Porsche 911. Williams Advanced Engineering applies technology developed for the Williams Formula 1 team to other industries. And that catastrophe was the starting point for the companies' mildly ambitious joint venture: creating the most advanced air-cooled Porsche 911 in the world.\\n\\nWonderful as a 1990 911 may be, it’s not quite an F1 engineer’s idea of perfection. “It’s a weird thing to go to a ride and handling engineer, and he says ‘This thing is a mess’, and I say ‘Yes, isn’t it great?’” says Singer CEO Mazen Fawaz. Singer Vehicle Design\\n\\nThe project, which they called the Dynamics and Lightweighting Study, started with a stock 1990 Porsche 911. (In 1998, Porsche switched the 911’s engine to a water-cooled system, a move that still gets the purists heated.) This week, the result is making its US debut at the caviar-coated Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, after wowing the crowds at Britain's Goodwood Festival of Speed last month.\\n\\nYou might expect an austere racing machine, stripped to the point where it has mesh instead of doors. But no: This is a beautiful, high gloss white 911 with bespoke carbon fiber seats, yellow interior trim details (Parallax White and Norfolk Yellow to the initiated), and a rear ducktail. It weighs nearly 1,000 pounds less than the 3000-pound original, and produces 500 horsepower—a twofold increase. And, according to Fawaz, it still drives like a classic 911, with all the idiosyncrasies of the rear-drive layout that owners adore. Ultimately, Singer will build just 75 cars based on the DLS study, for customers who hand over their stock car and an undisclosed, but definitely hefty, pile of money.\\n\\nIt wasn’t easy getting here. Wonderful as a 1990 911 may be, it’s not quite an F1 engineer’s idea of perfection. The folks at Williams are used to working on modern race cars, where every surface is tuned and refined, the suspension perfected, the steering inputs almost digital.\\n\\n“It’s a weird thing to go to a ride and handling engineer, and he says ‘this thing is a mess’, and I say ‘yes isn’t it great?’,” says Fawaz. “It’s like comedy, taking a vintage anything to a Formula 1 team, who make spacecraft in comparison.”\\n\\nMost of the many aerodynamic tweaks the team made are hard to spot: subtle changes to the front bumper, a totally redesigned underside, a low channel in the roof that changes airflow to improve downforce. Singer Vehicle Design\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges was getting airflow right. The ‘catastrophic’ rating on aerodynamics came when the Williams team ran the 911’s size and dimensions through their computational fluid dynamics package, which models airflow over a vehicle. They found lift at the front as well as the back at speed—grim news for grip and safe handling. And since Fawaz (reasonably) refused to let them reshape the car, they had to get creative.\\n\\nThe customer for this first transformation had requested a ducktail spoiler (which Porsche first put on the 1972 911 2.7RS) which should have been a good start for extra downforce at the back. But when Williams plugged that into its simulations, it saw nada. “It was completely ineffective,” says Fawaz. But he didn’t want to increase the size of the wing, GT3-style. Ultimately, they found a solution: cutting a low channel in the roof, invisible from the side profile, which directs air down and over the ducktail, making it work as designed.\\n\\nMost of the many aerodynamic tweaks the team made are similarly hidden. There are subtle changes to the front bumper, but they totally redesigned the underside of the car to control airflow and improve downforce. They revised the airflow on the underside of the decklid for better cooling for the powered-up engine, which still relies on air, not water, to pull away all the excess heat it creates. At one point the team even considered exhausting air through the cool new, circular, rear lights, but that plan didn’t add anything useful. The aerodynamicists redesigned the front air cooler intake and venting, and added a front splitter, to eliminate the lift at the front too.\\n\\n“Porsche did something super weird, they built a car in the 1960s and iterated on it,” Fawaz says. “It was always a little bit humble, not the most expensive, but always could perform with the best of them.”\\n\\nAnd with Singer’s and Williams’ new updates and reimagined components, it’s now enough to convince even Formula 1 engineers of its charms.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " \"Most Saturdays, my husband Seth and I spend approximately the whole day with our phones aimed at our son, taking pictures of him from slightly different angles. There’s a diptych of him dancing in the bagel shop. There’s one of him scooting in the park. Until a few weeks ago, we'd spend our Saturday night bickering over beers about who got to post which photo to our separate Instagram accounts.\\n\\nIt’s a glamorous life.\\n\\nMutual friends who follow us both on Instagram often wound up seeing our days play out there in mirror images of each other: pictures of me and our son on Seth’s Story; photos of Seth and our son two minutes later doing the exact same activity on mine. That might feel a bit repetitive for them, but it gets weirder for everyone else. Seth’s friends who don’t know or follow me only ever see pictures of me, and my friends who don’t know or follow Seth only see pictures of him. “My friends from high school see you on Instagram all the time but probably have no idea what I look like now,” he observed a few weeks ago. This is a common problem for couples.\\n\\nNow, we have a lot of real things going on—we’re about to move across the country, so we need to find a new place to live, and a new school for our son, and all the other hard tasks that come with uprooting a life. So, naturally, instead of doing any of those things, we decided now was the right time to solve this thorny Instagram problem once and for all. And we wouldn’t stop until we landed on a perfect solution.\\n\\nMaybe we should post more selfies? No, too much vanity. Maybe we should just swap the photos we take of each other and post them to our own accounts? Too much work. Hmm. We poured some wine. That’s when we get our really good ideas. What if, Seth posited, we just had one account?\\n\\nI scrunched up my face. I worried. Wouldn’t that entail a loss of self-identity? Then again, what bearing does Instagram have on our real identity, anyway? As individuals Seth and I are very different, yet our Instagrams are always almost identical—proof in itself that these curated windows on existence are not real insight into a person’s soul. They are merely a record of our weekends.\\n\\nSo Seth and I did it. Two weeks ago, we each put a photo of our faces on our personal Instagram accounts, overlayed with the message: “Follow our new family account at [REDACTED]. This account is over.” In the caption, we explained this was an open-ended experiment and that we would no longer be checking or posting to our personal accounts. Then we uploaded a very cheesy family photo to our new account, argued one last time over the name, each logged in on our respective phones, and sat on the couch clicking to “follow” all the people we had followed separately.\\n\\nImmediately, things went wrong. Instagram flagged our account as suspicious because we were following people too quickly. After managing to add around 200 friends, we got locked out for 24 hours. This was the first indication that Instagram is not set up for this kind of shared experience. To Instagram, a couple wanting to use the service together is a bot.\\n\\nEmily Dreyfuss\\n\\nWe’d wondered whether people would actually follow the new account, and we quickly got our answer: Some would! But not necessarily the ones we expected. Instagram is weird like that—sometimes your most avid “fans,” who watch every Story and send you emoji DMs, are people you barely interact with in real life. All our superlurkers and hypercommenters followed the new account immediately. As did our college friends and former colleagues. It was our family members who hesitated—knowing us well enough, perhaps, to suspect we’d quickly tire of the experiment and close the new account, thus making a fool of them.\\n\\nWell, joke’s on you, fam. After 10 days of using our new shared account, and despite near daily vexations, we’ve decided we like it. One of my brothers finally relented and followed us. Now he can see the video of his nephew singing “London Calling” into an unplugged microphone while wearing banana pajamas. High-quality content! The other brother is not yet convinced.\\n\\nThat’s because the idea of the joint account for a couple is admittedly obnoxious. It’s social media PDA, like when people enter a new relationship and the oxytocin makes them temporarily insane so they refer to themselves as “we” all the time. It’s gross. I understand not wanting to support it! I hate when people make Instagram accounts for their babies or dogs for the same reason—it’s saccharine. But I also always follow those accounts because I love pictures of babies and dogs. (The only thing I don’t love about those accounts is when people pretend their children or pets are writing the captions. Even I have a cheese threshold.)\\n\\nIt’s kind of mortifying to me to be such a “we” on social media, but it’s also truer to our lived experience. As our very best friend put it, “The idea of it is annoying, but the reality is that it’s better!” Now she has us all in one place. Our feed approximates the experience of hanging out with us IRL all the more accurately.\\n\\nNot everyone agrees with her. An old colleague of mine, who followed the new account, told me that though he will remain a loyal follower because he’s a mensch, he finds the whole thing annoying because he’s never met Seth and therefore doesn’t care much about Seth’s perspective, which is fair.\\n\\nBut for the most part, when polled, our followers said they liked the new account, and judged it to be only mildly irritating. Hell, only mildly irritating? I’ll take it.\\n\\nEmily Dreyfuss\\n\\nThe things Seth and I find aggravating about the new account are not what I anticipated. I thought it would be confusing to DM with our friends and comment on their photos because they wouldn’t know which of us they were talking to. Turns out, they know it’s always me because Seth has never in his life commented or sent a DM. I thought it would be weird because we have such different Insta habits—I hit the heart button on basically every photo I see on Insta, and Seth never has—but it turns out that doesn’t matter at all. Sure, there are probably people he’s always followed who are surprised that our account is now liking their photos at a rapid clip, but as it turns out, I don’t care! Also, you’re welcome.\\n\\nNo, the actual annoyances of sharing an account have nothing to do with us and everything to do with Instagram and its blasted algorithm. Because Instagram is not chronological, when I scroll through our account idly waiting in line at the pharmacy, it marks those posts as seen and buries them for Seth. If he watches a Story, that story cycles to the end of our feed and I never see it. In this way, Instagram thwarts our attempt at having a joint experience.\\n\\nOther than that, though, there are real benefits. For one, we’re both looking at Instagram less. That’s partially because making the conscious decision to merge accounts made us more aware that the pressure to cultivate some kind of “personal brand” on Instagram is absurd. And it’s partially that my feed is now filled with some people who I don’t really care about, so the whole thing is a little less appealing to me.\\n\\nThe experience also expanded both of our horizons a little bit. I’m exposed to way more tattoo artists from Europe, and he’s seeing a lot more women journalists from around the world. Plus, we seem to have thoroughly confused Instagram’s ad mechanism, which is now serving me equal parts Jack Ryan movie promos along with my customary (and unwanted) bra suggestions. We’re ad disruptors!\\n\\nThe part I like the best is checking our own Story and seeing something Seth has posted. I used to always rewatch my own Stories anyway, but it was a guilty act of navel gazing. I’d live my day, upload my day, then rewatch it. Why? I don’t know. I was just compelled to. Now that same compulsion lets me find unexpected images—photos or videos of Seth’s day. It’s nice.\\n\\nAnd we’re not the only ones doing this, though it’s far from a trend. Journalist Taylor Lorenz, who covers internet culture for The Atlantic, has two shared accounts with her boyfriend. They have kept their separate accounts, and use the two joint accounts to focus on specific interests. Teenagers commonly use the platform in a similar way, she points out. They’ll sometimes share group accounts with friends to post about something they’re all into, or more commonly to have a place to debate hot-button issues.\\n\\nBrands, of course, also have joint accounts. WIRED’s Instagram has multiple administrators. A few people on Twitter told me they have family members or friends with couples or family accounts. Given that, it would be nice if Instagram would create a proper group accounts option to support our kind. Instagram declined to comment on any plans to introduce group accounts.\\n\\n“I feel like running a joint account helps relieve pressure,” Lorenz says. Like me, she’s an active liker and commenter, but in joint accounts she doesn’t worry about engaging with everyone as much. “I think overall they're a good thing,” she told me in DM. “Since you can sort of both delude yourselves into thinking the other person is doing all the mundane work of keeping up with likes, engaging with all your friends' latest content etc, so then you check it less, which leads to a better life.”\\n\\nYes, I still feel a twinge of embarrassment about sharing an account with Seth sometimes. But so far, my tiny hang-up is the only real downside to our new joint-account life. If you’re considering it and you’re sensitive to the judgment of others, you should know that when I asked on Twitter whether anyone knew people who did this, the common response was “ew” and “I assume anybody who replies to this in the affirmative gets arrested.” But you know what? Lock me up, folks, because I love love and I love our joint Instagram account.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'Following more than a year of unrelenting focus on Russian cyber attacks on Silicon Valley giants, Facebook and Twitter announced Tuesday night that they\\'ve now also thwarted a network of suspicious accounts that appear to originate in Iran.\\n\\nFirst, Facebook announced it had taken down 652 pages, groups, and accounts for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior.\" Less than an hour after Facebook went public with the news, Twitter announced in a brief series of tweets that, working with \"industry partners,\" it had shut down 284 accounts, many of which it said were from Iran.\\n\\nThe news is a reminder of the broad scope of potential adversaries targeting American tech companies. But it simultaneously signals a strengthening alliance between those companies, which have begun proactively sharing the details of their investigations with other tech giants.\\n\\nOn a call with reporters Tuesday night, Facebook executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg described a multi-pronged investigation that unearthed several networks of bad actors. Some were associated with Russia, but others were affiliated with Iranian state media. \"These were networks of accounts that were misleading people about who they were and what they were doing,\" Zuckerberg explained. \"People need to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook.\"\\n\\nThe company credits the cybersecurity firm FireEye with detecting one group called Liberty Front Press, which was connected with several accounts and pages. They often posed as news organizations and civil society groups, but using publicly available website registration information and IP addresses, Facebook researchers found that the group was actually affiliated with Iranian state media. All in, more than 200,000 users followed at least one of these accounts or pages across Facebook and Instagram. Facebook didn\\'t respond to WIRED\\'s request for comment about whether any of these users had been notified.\\n\\n\\'I’ve been saying for months that there’s no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.\\' Democratic senator Mark Warner\\n\\nIn its own blog post Tuesday, FireEye cautioned that identifying the origins of these groups can be difficult, due to the nature of their activities, but said they had \"moderate confidence\" in their assessment about Iranian involvement. The post included a labyrinthine illustration that maps out the different pages and their web of promotion. According to FireEye, the network promoted issues that aligned with Iranian interests. Among the striking details they discovered were \"inauthentic social media personas, masquerading as American liberals supportive of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, heavily promoting Quds Day, a holiday established by Iran in 1979 to express support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the Liberty Front Press network, Facebook found another set of accounts and pages posing as news organizations that the company says had \"links\" to the Liberty Front Press group. But this network launched more traditional attacks, attempting to hack into other Facebook users\\' accounts and spread malware. Facebook says it\\'s working with law enforcement on further investigating its findings.\\n\\nThe cyberthreat posed by Iran has been the subject of concern in intelligence circles for years. But when the US reached a deal with the country in 2015, which lifted key sanctions, Iran\\'s cyber attacks seemed to have subsided. Meanwhile, the threat Russia posed only grew in the public consciousness after the 2016 election, when Russian actors hacked into the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign chair\\'s emails, while also carrying out an influence campaign across nearly every social media platform. And yet, lawmakers have recently cautioned against taking an overly myopic view of the scope of cyber threats facing the tech sector.\\n\\nDuring a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, just hours before Facebook\\'s announcement, Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal warned, forebodingly, \"Until there’s real action, Vladimir Putin will operate with impunity, and he will continue to use a playbook which becomes the same playbook used by other countries, notably Iran. I believe there will be news about Iranian aggression in the cyber domain.\"\\n\\nFollowing Facebook\\'s disclosure, Democratic senator Mark Warner said in a statement, “I’ve been saying for months that there’s no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.\"\\n\\nFacebook\\'s discovery underscores the level of vigilance required to detect threats from multiple state actors at once, even as the company tries to find and memorize the fingerprints others have left behind. In addition to the two networks associated with Liberty Front Press, the company also detected a suspicious network that shared content about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi, and also shared content about the United States and United Kingdom in English. These 168 pages and 140 accounts racked up 823,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram. This group also ran $6,000 worth of ads, the oldest of which ran in 2012. Despite signals indicating these accounts and pages were connected, they \"were not presenting a coordinated front in how they identified themselves,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\\'s head of cybersecurity policy, said on the press call.\\n\\nFacebook noted that it also shut down additional accounts and pages associated with Russian military intelligence, but the company was light on details about what this group shared or how many Facebook users followed them. The company was also reluctant to blame Russia for another suspicious network it shut down at the end of July, saying that all of these investigations are still ongoing.\\n\\nIn his remarks to reporters, Zuckerberg continually stressed the need for tech companies and government agencies to work together to investigate and prevent these threats. His sentiment echoed Microsoft CEO Brad Smith, who earlier Tuesday also called on the government to act when he announced that Microsoft had thwarted a series of Russian cyber attacks on political groups in the United States.\\n\\n\"No one company can win this fight on its own,\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"Big things happen when computers get smaller. Or faster. And quantum computing is about chasing perhaps the biggest performance boost in the history of technology. The basic idea is to smash some barriers that limit the speed of existing computers by harnessing the counterintuitive physics of subatomic scales.\\n\\nIf the tech industry pulls off that, ahem, quantum leap, you won’t be getting a quantum computer for your pocket. Don’t start saving for an iPhone Q. We could, however, see significant improvements in many areas of science and technology, such as longer-lasting batteries for electric cars or advances in chemistry that reshape industries or enable new medical treatments. Quantum computers won’t be able to do everything faster than conventional computers, but on some tricky problems they have advantages that would enable astounding progress.\\n\\nIt’s not productive (or polite) to ask people working on quantum computing when exactly those dreamy applications will become real. The only thing for sure is that they are still many years away. Prototype quantum computing hardware is still embryonic. But powerful—and, for tech companies, profit-increasing—computers powered by quantum physics have recently started to feel less hypothetical.\\n\\nThe cooling and support structure for one of IBM's quantum computing chips (the tiny black square at the bottom of the image). Amy Lombard\\n\\nThat’s because Google, IBM, and others have decided it’s time to invest heavily in the technology, which, in turn, has helped quantum computing earn a bullet point on the corporate strategy PowerPoint slides of big companies in areas such as finance, like JPMorgan, and aerospace, like Airbus. In 2017, venture investors plowed $241 million into startups working on quantum computing hardware or software worldwide, according to CB Insights. That’s triple the amount in the previous year.\\n\\nLike the befuddling math underpinning quantum computing, some of the expectations building around this still-impractical technology can make you lightheaded. If you squint out the window of a flight into SFO right now, you can see a haze of quantum hype drifting over Silicon Valley. But the enormous potential of quantum computing is undeniable, and the hardware needed to harness it is advancing fast. If there were ever a perfect time to bend your brain around quantum computing, it’s now. Say “Schrodinger’s superposition” three times fast, and we can dive in.\\n\\nThe History of Quantum Computing Explained\\n\\nThe prehistory of quantum computing begins early in the 20th century, when physicists began to sense they had lost their grip on reality.\\n\\nFirst, accepted explanations of the subatomic world turned out to be incomplete. Electrons and other particles didn’t just neatly carom around like Newtonian billiard balls, for example. Sometimes they acted like waves instead. Quantum mechanics emerged to explain such quirks, but introduced troubling questions of its own. To take just one brow-wrinkling example, this new math implied that physical properties of the subatomic world, like the position of an electron, didn’t really exist until they were observed.\\n\\nIf you find that baffling, you’re in good company. A year before winning a Nobel for his contributions to quantum theory, Caltech’s Richard Feynman remarked that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.” The way we experience the world just isn’t compatible. But some people grasped it well enough to redefine our understanding of the universe. And in the 1980s a few of them—including Feynman—began to wonder if quantum phenomena like subatomic particles' “don’t look and I don’t exist” trick could be used to process information. The basic theory or blueprint for quantum computers that took shape in the 80s and 90s still guides Google and others working on the technology.\\n\\nBefore we belly flop into the murky shallows of quantum computing 0.101, we should refresh our understanding of regular old computers. As you know, smartwatches, iPhones, and the world’s fastest supercomputer all basically do the same thing: they perform calculations by encoding information as digital bits, aka 0s and 1s. A computer might flip the voltage in a circuit on and off to represent 1s and 0s for example.\\n\\nQuantum computers do calculations using bits, too. After all, we want them to plug into our existing data and computers. But quantum bits, or qubits, have unique and powerful properties that allow a group of them to do much more than an equivalent number of conventional bits.\\n\\nQubits can be built in various ways, but they all represent digital 0s and 1s using the quantum properties of something that can be controlled electronically. Popular examples—at least among a very select slice of humanity—include superconducting circuits, or individual atoms levitated inside electromagnetic fields. The magic power of quantum computing is that this arrangement lets qubits do more than just flip between 0 and 1. Treat them right and they can flip into a mysterious extra mode called a superposition.\\n\\nThe looped cables connect the chip at the bottom of the structure to its control system. Amy Lombard\\n\\nYou may have heard that a qubit in superposition is both 0 and 1 at the same time. That’s not quite true and also not quite false—there’s just no equivalent in Homo sapiens’ humdrum classical reality. If you have a yearning to truly grok it, you must make a mathematical odyssey WIRED cannot equip you for. But in the simplified and dare we say perfect world of this explainer, the important thing to know is that the math of a superposition describes the probability of discovering either a 0 or 1 when a qubit is read out—an operation that crashes it out of a quantum superposition into classical reality. A quantum computer can use a collection of qubits in superpositions to play with different possible paths through a calculation. If done correctly, the pointers to incorrect paths cancel out, leaving the correct answer when the qubits are read out as 0s and 1s.\\n\\nJargon for the Quantum Qurious What's a qubit? A device that uses quantum mechanical effects to represent 0s and 1s of digital data, similar to the bits in a conventional computer. What's a superposition? It's the trick that makes quantum computers tick, and makes qubits more powerful than ordinary bits. A superposition is in an intuition-defying mathematical combination of both 0 and 1. Quantum algorithms can use a group of qubits in a superposition to shortcut through calculations. What's quantum entanglement? A quantum effect so unintuitive that Einstein dubbed it “spooky action at a distance.” When two qubits in a superposition are entangled, certain operations on one have instant effects on the other, a process that helps quantum algorithms be more powerful than conventional ones. What's quantum speedup? The holy grail of quantum computing—a measure of how much faster a quantum computer could crack a problem than a conventional computer could. Quantum computers aren’t well-suited to all kinds of problems, but for some they offer an exponential speedup, meaning their advantage over a conventional computer grows explosively with the size of the input problem.\\n\\nFor some problems that are very time consuming for conventional computers, this allows a quantum computer to find a solution in far fewer steps than a conventional computer would need. Grover’s algorithm, a famous quantum search algorithm, could find you in a phone book with 100 million names with just 10,000 operations. A classical search algorithm would require 50 million operations, on average, to spool through all the listings and find you. For Grover’s and some other quantum algorithms, the bigger the initial problem—or phonebook—the further behind a conventional computer is left in the digital dust.\\n\\nThe reason we don’t have useful quantum computers today is that qubits are extremely finicky. The quantum effects they must control are very delicate, and stray heat or noise can flip 0s and 1s, or wipe out a crucial superposition. Qubits have to be carefully shielded, and operated at very cold temperatures, sometimes only fractions of a degree above absolute zero. Most plans for quantum computing depend on using a sizable chunk of a quantum processor’s power to correct its own errors, caused by misfiring qubits.\\n\\nRecent excitement about quantum computing stems from progress in making qubits less flaky. That’s giving researchers the confidence to start bundling the devices into larger groups. Startup Rigetti Computing recently announced it has built a processor with 128 qubits made with aluminum circuits that are super-cooled to make them superconducting. Google and IBM have announced their own chips with 72 and 50 qubits, respectively. That’s still far fewer than would be needed to do useful work with a quantum computer—it would probably require at least thousands—but as recently as 2016 those companies’ best chips had qubits only in the single digits. After tantalizing computer scientists for 30 years, practical quantum computing may not exactly be close, but it has begun to feel a lot closer.\\n\\nWhat the Future Holds for Quantum Computing\\n\\nSome large companies and governments have started treating quantum computing research like a race—perhaps fittingly it’s one where both the distance to the finish line and the prize for getting there are unknown.\\n\\nGoogle, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft have all expanded their teams working on the technology, with a growing swarm of startups such as Rigetti in hot pursuit. China and the European Union have each launched new programs measured in the billions of dollars to stimulate quantum R&D. And in the US, the Trump White House has created a new committee to coordinate government work on quantum information science. Several bills were introduced to Congress in 2018 proposing new funding for quantum research, totalling upwards of $1.3 billion. It’s not quite clear what the first killer apps of quantum computing will be, or when they will appear. But there’s a sense that whoever is first make these machines useful will gain big economic and national security advantages.\\n\\nCopper structures conduct heat well and connect the apparatus to its cooling system. Amy Lombard\\n\\nBack in the world of right now, though, quantum processors are too simple to do practical work. Google is working to stage a demonstration known as quantum supremacy, in which a quantum processor would solve a carefully designed math problem beyond existing supercomputers. But that would be an historic scientific milestone, not proof quantum computing is ready to do real work.\\n\\nAs quantum computer prototypes get larger, the first practical use for them will probably be for chemistry simulations. Computer models of molecules and atoms are vital to the hunt for new drugs or materials. Yet conventional computers can’t accurately simulate the behavior of atoms and electrons during chemical reactions. Why? Because that behavior is driven by quantum mechanics, the full complexity of which is too great for conventional machines. Daimler and Volkswagen have both started investigating quantum computing as a way to improve battery chemistry for electric vehicles. Microsoft says other uses could include designing new catalysts to make industrial processes less energy intensive, or even to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change.\\n\\nQuantum computers would also be a natural fit for code-breaking. We’ve known since the 90s that they could zip through the math underpinning the encryption that secures online banking, flirting, and shopping. Quantum processors would need to be much more advanced to do this, but governments and companies are taking the threat seriously. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of evaluating new encryption systems that could be rolled out to quantum-proof the internet.\\n\\nWhen cooled to operating temperature, the whole assembly is hidden inside this white insulated casing.

That’s further in the future and less well mapped out than chemistry or code-breaking applications, but researchers argue they can figure out the details down the line as they play around with larger and larger quantum processors.

       " \"On December 13, 2011, Paul Allen, the reclusive billionaire and cofounder of Microsoft, stood in front of a group of reporters in Seattle and told them about his wild new plan. Wearing the tech-Brahmin uniform of navy blazer, dress shirt, and conspicuously absent tie, Allen made some introductory remarks and then rolled a video simulation of a strange beast of an aircraft leaving an oversize hangar. This was Strato\\xadlaunch. It would be the largest airplane, by wingspan, ever created. The twin-fuselage, catamaran-style aircraft would be a flying launchpad, its purpose to heave a half-million-pound rocket ship to cruising altitude and then drop it, whereupon the rocket would ignite its engines for a fiery ascent into space. Allen’s hope was that this extraordinary bird would be able to do quick laps between the ground and the stratosphere, making access to space no more exotic than a New York–to–Boston commuter flight. Burt Rutan took the microphone next. Rutan, a gregarious designer of exotic aircraft, wore a light-blue work shirt and sported huge Elvis-style muttonchops. He was the original architect of the outlandish endeavor and the person who had sold Allen on the project. “Right here in front of us is a very large mistake,” he said, landing heavily on the word mistake and jabbing his finger at a model of the plane. The problem, he explained, was that no one in the room could possibly grasp how friggin’ big Stratolaunch would be. For them to have any sense, they’d have to understand that even a Boeing 747 would seem like a Tinkertoy in comparison. Rutan’s devilish grin said it all: This would be a plane to defy the imagination. The plane, he and Allen said, would take its first flight in 2015. Three years past that target date, the plane finally exists, and as Rutan promised, it is one big mama. As I discovered, nothing—not even a Rutan-approved scale model—can prepare you for an encounter with it. This past December I traveled to the Mojave Air and Space Port, a desert city of giant industrial structures in Southern California, where Stratolaunch was built. The plane’s facility on the eastern edge of the port stands out among the other structures. After walking through some drab offices, I was escorted into the approximately 100,000-square-foot hangar. The gleaming white Stratolaunch didn’t just fill the expanse; it reached into every corner of it. There was no way to take in the monster with a single glance. Starting near its tail, I walked through and around it, craning my neck and stretching on my tiptoes to gather mental snapshots of the two fuselages and the white drag strip of a wing and stitch them together into one panoramic picture.

Ish.\\n\\nWhy Phoenix's Airplanes Can't Take Off in Extreme Heat\\n\\nThe Age of Electric Aviation Is Just 30 Years Away Everything about Stratolaunch is supersized. It has six screaming Pratt & Whitney turbofan jet engines, salvaged from three 747s. Its maximum takeoff weight is 1.3 million pounds. It’s got more than 80 miles of wiring. Most astounding is its 385-foot wingspan, the spec that puts Stratolaunch in the history books. That number may not seem remarkable, but on a single airplane wing 385 feet is an eternity. It’s a football field plus the end zones and a little bit more. If the Wright brothers had begun their initial Kitty Hawk flight at the tip of one Stratolaunch wing, they could have completed the journey and done it twice more before they reached the other end. Though the two fuselages look identical, only the right one has a cockpit, largely preserved from one of the 747s, with a throttle, foot pedal, and even some analog displays that a commercial pilot working in the 1970s might find familiar. One of the seats is covered by a sheepskin-like cushion of the type often found in New York City taxis. Looking out the window, the second fuselage is so far away that it looks like a plane sitting on an adjacent runway. It’s hard to imagine this mammoth structure rising into the air. But the team—without Rutan, who retired in 2011—has been methodically taking it through a series of tests: bearing its own weight, firing its engines, taxiing down 2-plus miles of runway. Allen promises Stratolaunch will ascend as early as this fall. Thousands of people will turn their eyes to Mojave when that first flight happens. But after that, what? The original plan was to create a more reliable and flexible way to shoot satellites into space. But while Stratolaunch’s development has dragged on, the private space industry has leaped ahead. Other billionaires, notably Elon Musk, have dazzled the world with fiery launches and wild achievements such as reusable rockets and orbiting sports cars. The industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and numerous companies are scheming to lower the cost and increase the reliability of rocket launches. Musk’s SpaceX was going to supply Allen with the rockets Strato\\xadlaunch would carry, but it ditched the project years ago. The mammoth aircraft inevitably brings to mind the Spruce Goose, the much-mocked giant airplane and pet project of tycoon Howard Hughes. Allen had visited the legendary plane in its home in an Oregon museum. That plane (it was actually made mostly of birch, not spruce) was intended to send supplies and soldiers to combat during World War II, but it flew only once, for just a mile, long after the conflict was over. Stratolaunch, too, could be obsolete before its massive wing ever reaches the sky. Is biggest better? Maybe. Maybe not. But have you seen this thing? Paul Allen, the billionaire funding Strato\\xadlaunch, has been fascinated with space travel since childhood. “When you see that giant plane, it’s a little nutty,” he says. But his goal is more practical: competing in the private space business. Joe Pugliese\\n\\nAs a teenager, Paul Allen was a sci-fi and rocketry nerd. He dreamed of becoming an astronaut, but that ambition was scuttled by nearsighted\\xadness. His childhood bedroom was filled with science fiction and space books. Bill Gates remembers Allen’s obsession. “Even when I first met him—he was in tenth grade and I was in eighth—he had read way more science fiction than anyone else,” says Gates, who later founded Microsoft with Allen. “Way more.” One of Allen’s favorites was a popular science classic called Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel, by Willy Ley, first published in 1944. As Allen tells it in his memoir, he was crushed when he visited his parents as an adult and went to his old room to reference a book. He discovered that his mother had sold his collection. (The sale price: $75.) Using a blowup of an old photo of the room, Allen dispatched scouts to painstakingly re-create his boyhood library. Allen never stopped thinking about space. In April 1981, during crunch time for Microsoft’s most important project—developing an operating system for the upcoming IBM personal computer—Allen up and left, joining a colleague on a field trip to Florida to see the first space shuttle launch. (Gates, for the record, still seems a bit annoyed about that.) “It was unbelievably impressive,” Allen says now of that launch. But he never seriously imagined getting involved in rocketry, until he met Burt Rutan. Rutan had been hooked on airplanes since he was 8 years old. He started gaining recognition in the 1970s, selling plans for small aircraft that intrepid enthusiasts could build for themselves. His designs reimagined what a plane could be, changing up the placement of fins, wings, and even cockpits. In 1982 he started his company, Scaled Composites, in the California desert. He built planes that looked like praying mantises and others that had the whimsy of a Playmobil toy. (Five of his creations are now on display in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.) The company changed ownership several times over the years, until Northrop Grumman acquired it a decade ago. As Scaled Composites churned out cunning, award-winning designs, it became the aviation equivalent of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, staffed by stubborn outcasts who had been lured by the charisma of their iconoclast boss. “It was the dream job,” says Matt Stinemetze, Scaled’s chief engineer, who joined in his early twenties. “Burt was this legendary designer who designed all these home-builds that were weird and backward. It was almost like we always made these very different things because we could.” By 1996, Allen, who had long since left Microsoft and was pursuing an eclectic range of investments (including snapping up the Portland Trail Blazers), had begun exploring the idea of delivering broadband from the sky. He heard about a Rutan creation he thought might be useful for this enterprise, and he flew to Mojave in his personal Boeing 757 to ask about it face-to-face. Nothing came of the conversation that day—except that Rutan learned Allen was a “space nut” with money to spend. It was a fateful connection. A few years later, when Rutan was contemplating building the first private rocket that could send a human into space, he made a pilgrimage to Seattle to visit Allen. One aspect of his plan, he said, was to launch a manned spaceship from an airplane, not a launch pad. Rutan thought he could do it with less than $20 million. Allen saw in Rutan’s idea an opportunity to open up space the same way he and Bill Gates had popularized computers. He agreed to fund the spaceship, and they closed the deal with a handshake. They also decided to enter the competition for the Ansari XPrize, which offered $10 million to the first team to send a person into suborbital space twice in two weeks using the same equipment. Rutan called that effort SpaceShipOne. Richard Branson, another billionaire fascinated by space, and who knew Rutan, caught wind of it and raced to the Mojave. He chipped in $1 million in exchange for branding the rocket ship with the Virgin logo. Branson’s ultimate interest was space tourism—high-priced, suborbital thrill rides—and he felt that SpaceShipOnecould give him a high-profile start. On September 29, 2004, a SpaceShipOne test pilot barely, but triumphantly, crossed the 62-mile border between Earth’s atmosphere and space. Five days later, another pilot repeated the trick. Rutan and Allen won the XPrize. Allen’s excitement at the achievement was dampened by his increasing anxiety. The first few SpaceShipOne sorties were tense affairs, with unplanned spins and even a near-crash landing. The space shuttle Columbia’s fatal 2003 reentry into Earth’s atmosphere, which killed seven astronauts, was still fresh, and he was haunted by the prospect that they might lose one of the pilots. As Allen later wrote, when the rockets fired during the prize-winning SpaceShipOne flight, Branson asked him, “Isn’t this better than the best sex you’ve ever had?” Allen thought otherwise. “If I was this anxious during any kind of interpersonal activity, I couldn’t enjoy it very much,” he told himself. Branson wanted to license the SpaceShipOne technology from Allen for space tourism, and Allen agreed. Branson’s effort to develop Virgin Galactic ended up marred by two fatal accidents, the exact scenario that had frightened Allen. (Virgin Galactic is still planning to send customers for a 90-minute whirl.) Allen was out of the space race. He turned his focus to his new institute on the human brain, a real estate push in his native Seattle, and a different kind of ship: his roughly 414-foot yacht, known as the Octopus. Burt Rutan, a designer of exotic aircraft, spent two decades developing what he called the Big Airplane. He retired in 2011, and Stratolaunch does not include some of his more out-there ideas. “Burt is not the designer of the airplane in Mojave now,” he says. Joe Pugliese\\n\\nRutan, meanwhile, was thinking about the Brobdingnagian airplane that would eventually become Stratolaunch. In 1992 he had been summoned by Antonio Elias, a senior executive at a commercial space company called Orbital Sciences Corporation, to meet with a small group. Elias was exploring the idea of building a heavy spacecraft that could be launched from a giant airplane. One problem with ground-based rockets is that they can take off from only a small number of facilities, like the Kennedy Space Center or Vandenberg Air Force Base, where competition for launch time creates long delays. A plane-based launch would create new possibilities. But a plane that big had other challenges. Rutan’s analysis concluded that to deliver the weight of the rocket Elias was talking about—up to 640,000 pounds—you’d need a wingspan of almost 400 feet. That wing had to be strong too. In addition to two fuselages and tons of fuel, it would be carrying a set of jet engines and that massive vehicle. Rutan planned to build the plane from nonmetal composites, rather than aluminum, to keep the weight down, but making the composite strong enough presented another problem. Rutan solved this dilemma in part with a process called pultrusion, in which a machine pulls a material at a constant rate and then bakes it until it hardens, a way to mold huge segments of the plane with a consistent strength. This technique let the engineers manufacture the very long spars that fortify the giant wing. Rutan began working on a design, even as he realized that the odds were against it ever being built. Using traditional construction methods and materials, the price tag might stretch past a billion, perhaps even reaching the cost of a nuclear aircraft carrier. He figured he could build it more cheaply, especially if he took his scavenger mentality to the limit. “I reasoned that if I could lift out engines, pylons, landing gear, actuators, electricals, and cockpit stuff from 747s, it was doable for us,” he says. Over the next 20 years, Rutan worked with three prospective customers as he continued designing what he referred to as the Big Airplane. He won’t say who the customers were, but none of them took the step of commissioning it. Then Allen decided to get back in the space business. When I first talked to Allen, he was vague about why he decided to fund Stratolaunch. “I did my thing, we won the prize,” he says, speaking by video conference from Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the former home of Georgia O’Keeffe. It’s one of at least seven properties he owns. He’s seated with his legs stretched out on a deep couch, almost swallowed up by giant patterned seat cushions. I’m talking to him from Seattle, and I’m not sure if his lack of eye contact with me is a result of shyness or because my screen image isn’t aligned with the camera. “Burt Rutan planted a seed that he wanted to do something orbital with a scaled-up plane,” he finally says. Allen later said he had another reason: He’d been watching as NASA pulled back on space operations and private businesses emerged to fill the gaps. The terrain was becoming irresistible, and he figured this was his opportunity. Let Richard Branson offer suborbital thrill rides to civilians. Let Elon Musk go to Mars. Allen suspected there was another business proposition. The cost of building satellites was dropping as computers, cameras, and sensors became cheaper and more powerful. Their uses were growing too. They could be used to detect illegal ocean fishing—another Allen-funded project—or monitor humanitarian crises. If there were a reliable and thrifty way to launch satellites, people might come up with more uses, creating an even bigger market. That’s what happened with PCs. Allen thought air launches could hasten that process. They are not as sensitive to weather as those held at traditional vertical launch facilities, allowing for more flexible takeoffs. They could also be more affordable, as the airplane can be reused many times. But no one had ever built an air-launch system capable of heaving super-heavy payloads into orbit. Allen incorporated the Stratolaunch company and set about building the huge hangar for the plane in Mojave, next to Scaled Composites. (The plane’s original codename was Maliboo, but the Scaled Composites people called it Roc, after the giant bird of prey in Middle Eastern mythology. Rutan jokes that it’s really an acronym for Rutan’s on Crack.) Allen was still queasy about putting lives in peril, but this time he had a rationale. “There’s a distinction between taking someone’s ticket for a joyride in space and having a commercial test pilot who knows the risk,” Allen says. Even so, he admits that it takes fortitude to send any human into the great void. “It’s different than having a bug in Microsoft Word or something,” he adds. “You have to be comfortable that something bad might happen—it’s a whole other level of anxiety.” Though retired, Rutan still sits on the Strato\\xadlaunch board. He makes a point to credit the designers at Scaled Composites, albeit in his own fashion: “Burt Rutan designed different configurations for the Big Airplane for over 20 years,” he says, referring to himself in the third person. “But Burt is not the designer of the airplane in Mojave now.” That’s kind of a shame because, as Rutan describes it, his original vision for Stratolaunch was even more radical than the plane now in a hangar in the Mojave spaceport. He had situated the cockpit toward the tail, attached to a massive foil connecting the dual fuselages. The pilot’s placement at the back of the aircraft would offer a view of the rest of the vehicle, making it easier to control. Stratolaunch’s current CEO, Jean Floyd, explains that the designers determined that the rear cockpit and its foil put too much weight at the back of the plane, so they switched early on to a design where the two fuselages would be connected only by the main wing. The team worked to speed up construction by using off-the-shelf parts whenever possible, the most conspicuous example being the repurposing of three 747s. But the surface of the plane had to be created from scratch. “This vehicle has some of the largest composite components ever built in the world, made by hand by fabricators, all made by our guys,” says Jacob Leichtweisz\\xad-Fortier, who works on the plane. The most massive pieces were 285-foot spars that give the wing its resiliency, each one weighing 18,000 pounds. The team first constructed the wing out of the gargantuan spars and built the rest of the plane around it. The plane’s extreme size led to some unexpected complications: The scaffolding needed to assemble the wing had to be about 40 feet high. “It starts to look like a building,” Stinemetze says. “In fact, the way California treats it, it is a building. It has to meet codes for sprinklers and electrical power.” When the plane was ready to emerge from its scaffolding and get towed out of the hangar, just lowering it 2 feet to the ground took eight hours, Floyd says. While the plane was taking shape, Stratolaunch was struggling to find rockets to launch. For a few years, Allen’s company searched for a replacement for SpaceX and finally settled on the Pegasus XL rocket, built by Orbital ATK. (Orbital is also owned by Northrop Grumman.) But the choice of rocket was anticlimactic. More than 40 Pegasus rockets have already launched from the air, usually from a converted Lockheed L011 Tristar, a commercial airliner that is almost completely retired. It calls into question the whole Stratolaunch enterprise. Why build the world’s biggest aircraft just to launch a rocket with a small payload that can be shot off from a creaky out-of-service plane? For Stratolaunch to fulfill its promise, Allen realized, he would have to build his own rockets. In 2016, Stratolaunch began that process. “At first we looked at using off-the-shelf engines, even rebuilding surplus space shuttle engines,” Allen says. But then the company’s engineers realized that new technologies, especially 3-D printing, would be more efficient. “You can just print these engines almost from scratch for so much less,” Allen says, estimating that a new engine can be printed for about a fifth of the cost of repurposing space shuttle overstock. Strato\\xadlaunch formed a team of rocket designers, led by SpaceX’s former head of propulsion, Jeff Thornburg. The company will test its engines at a NASA facility in Stennis, Mississippi. Sharing their road map publicly for the first time, Thornburg and Floyd laid out their plans for Stratolaunch: Its first custom rocket ship will be considerably bigger than the Pegasus, able to transport multiple satellites or other payloads. This medium-size rocket is nicknamed Kraken, after the legendary Icelandic sea monster. Floyd says customers will be able to use it to get satellites into low Earth orbit for less than $30 million, a competitive price and about half of what SpaceX charges for a launch of its Falcon 9 rocket. Floyd estimates that Kraken will be operational in 2022.\\n\\nThe next steps are more ambitious. In a project codenamed Black Ice, Stratolaunch is designing reusable space planes that will take off from the big airplane and go into orbit. The first one will be programmed to open its bay doors once in orbit and release its payload, perhaps even a fleet of satellites, into space. And then it will return to Earth. The idea is not all that different from the original space shuttle, which was a reusable vehicle that could also steer itself down from orbit to land on a runway. It can “come back and land at Mojave where the plane is waiting, the fuel system is waiting,” Floyd says. “You roll up underneath the plane, you refuel, you put the next payload in, and you go again.” Finally, Stratolaunch aims to build a second version of Black Ice that can carry astronauts. That ship won’t be flying for at least a decade. But by then, who knows what Stratolaunch’s competitors will be up to? Though Allen reportedly plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his space enterprise, and is its sole investor, billions are being plowed into companies such as Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, both of which are trying to cut costs in the private space industry with reusable booster rockets that take off from the ground, not air launches. The companies have deals with NASA and commercial customers worth billions of dollars. Traditional defense contractors are also developing their own orbital rockets. And a new generation of people are thinking up new approaches to space. Earlier this year came news that a startup called SpinLaunch was developing a system in which a catapult-like contraption could efficiently zip satellites into orbit, aiming to cut prices to less than $500,000 per launch. Investors include Airbus Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. Stratolaunch is not commenting on whether it has any customers signed up. Floyd suggests the business part of Stratolaunch is a work in progress. “They love this,” he says, “but this has to fly first.” In other words, get the thing in the air, then they’ll talk. Rutan explains his design for an amphi\\xadbious plane. Joe Pugliese Rutan keeps models of many of his aircraft, including the Boomerang, pictured with his role model: Elvis Presley. (“Music died when Elvis died,” he says.) Joe Pugliese\",\n",
       " 'A big thing happened this weekend. Crazy Rich Asians hit theaters and brought in an impressive $34 million over its five-day weekend. (It technically opened Wednesday night.) That may not qualify as \"crazy rich\" in the era of $100 million-plus Star Wars opening weekends, but for context, it\\'s the best-performing comedy since last year’s Girls Trip—which went on to earn over $115 million domestically. Crazy Rich Asians has the power, and buzz, to do even better based on this weekend’s turnout.\\n\\nBut beyond being a big hit, it’s also a big deal. It’s been 25 years since The Joy Luck Club—the last movie with an all-Asian cast to get a wide release—hit theaters, and that’s, frankly, far too long. Like, a quarter of a century too long. But now director Jon M. Chu’s movie, which is full of shining performances by Constance Wu (Fresh Off the Boat), Awkwafina (Ocean’s 8), Michelle Yeoh (Star Trek: Discovery), Gemma Chan (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and newcomer Henry Golding, is here, and it’s on track to be the event movie of the summer.\\n\\nAll of which is to say, we gathered a handful of writers and editors—Pia Ceres, Phuc Pham, Brian Raftery, and Angela Watercutter—to hash out their various feelings about Crazy Rich Asians. Read on.\\n\\nAngela Watercutter: I want to start with a question for everybody: What was your experience in the theater watching Crazy Rich Asians? I went on opening night, and some of the film’s cast—Awkwafina, Ken Jeong, and Jimmy O. Yang among them—came out to surprise (and throw concessions at) the audience at the theater I went to, but even before they showed up everyone seemed amped to be there. And the energy only continued once the movie began. Folks were clapping, gasping, crying. Was it the same for you all?\\n\\nPia Ceres: I think there was a bit of trepidation when I walked into the theater. Sitting in a majority Asian American audience, I picked up on collective excitement mingled with worry, like Will this be good? Will this represent us well? But once Jeong landed a perfect joke about Asian accents, the theater erupted with laughter—and I let my guard down.\\n\\nThe gravity of Crazy Rich Asians didn’t fully hit me, though, until I was walking out of the theater. A white man remarked, not unkindly, “Well, that was just another rom-com.” I felt the urge to flail my popcorn bucket in protest: It wasn\\'t just any rom-com to me! But maybe both of us were right. Maybe it speaks to the movie’s historic achievement that these impressions can coexist.\\n\\nTake, for example, that searing mah-jongg showdown. My grandma taught me how to play when I was a kid, but I’ve totally forgotten (sorry Grandma!). So I was acutely aware of the moments when a character flipped a tile onscreen and other moviegoers gasped. They “got it” just a split second before I did. And I think those disparate perceptions—the gap between what a tile flip means to one viewer or another, a gap that doesn’t compromise one’s appreciation of the scene—makes Crazy Rich Asians such an incredible movie.\\n\\nYou can (and should!) enjoy it as a blithe love story. I rooted for Wu’s heroine, whose pluck brings to mind a modern-day Lizzie Bennet. I swooned for Golding’s abs. I bawled when Kina Grannis lent her soulful voice to a wedding scene. It is so much fun to watch.\\n\\nAnd yet. CRA will mean something different for people who are, perhaps for the first time in a Hollywood blockbuster, seeing their music, their foods, their accents represented in a way that feels genuine and normal. I felt that long-awaited flash of recognition in the protagonist’s relationship with her immigrant mother. It’s not reductive to call Crazy Rich Asians a lush, delightful rom-com; but if you’ve had a certain set of cultural experiences, it’s also so much more.\\n\\nAs far as Asian representation goes, it’s obviously narrow in scope (you can glean as much from the title). It does, though, give me a tremendous amount of hope: that everyone in the cast will become super-mega-famous. That this “first” will open the door to “more.” And that future moviegoers won’t have to wait as long as I had to, to see a movie like this.\\n\\nPhuc Pham: I got to my screening pretty close to showtime, and I was surprised to see how many seats were already taken up. I had been tracking this movie ever since the book got optioned, but that was when it really hit me that CRA could be big.\\n\\nLike Pia, I’m hopeful that CRA’s success will lead to more robust roles for Asians. But to echo our colleague Jason Parham, if this is the tentpole for Asian American films going forward, I’m worried that America will get used to the representation of Asians as well-to-do—something that feels dangerously close to the myth that Asian Amerians are the model minority. The common refrain I hear from friends who supported this movie and are tuned into Asian American politics is that these are just baby steps.\\n\\nWatercutter: Totally. Hopefully this film will open the door for a variety of new stories from Asian filmmakers and actors—all of them different from the one told in Crazy Rich Asians. (Hear that, Hollywood?)\\n\\nBrian Raftery: Of the many milestones achieved by Crazy Rich Asians, it’s worth noting that this weekend marked the first time in a while that millions of people showed up in theaters to see a romantic-comedy-drama (and with its mother-girlfriend showdown and adultery subplot, CRA, to me, definitely feels more rom-com-dram than strictly rom-com). It’s a genre the studios have largely abandoned in the past few years, as mid-budget love stories no longer make quite as much financial sense as they did in the B.C. (Before Capes) era. In the late ’90s, there were still plenty of grown-up relationship tales, like The Best Man and Jerry Maguire. But they’ve all but disappeared from theaters in the last few years, having migrated to Netflix or the Hallmark Channel. So it was kind of a kick to watch a colorful, lovestruck adult drama, while surrounded by other semi-adults such as myself.\\n\\nAlso, CRA plays beautifully on the big screen: Director Jon M. Chu has a wildly varied filmography, one that includes everything from a G.I. Joe sequel to a pair of Step Up movies to a Justin Bieber 3-D concert documentary. His movies are often in motion, and there’s a vibrant, fast-moving, yet unshowy energy to CRA, which moves briskly from one ornate setting to the next (though none of the film’s visuals can match the majesty that is Ken Jeong’s Versace bomber jacket, which looks like it was flown in from Sgt. Pepper’s residency in Las Vegas). And the Mahjong duel at the end of the film is one of the most impressively staged scenes of any movie this year: a tense battle of wills that’s no less dramatic if you don’t know the rules of the game.\\n\\nBut the precision and flair with which CRA is directed only serves to highlight what, to my mind, is the film’s biggest detriment: a script that throws together way too many subplots, feels oddly uncurious about its characters—is there anything to know about Nick, other than he’s, you know, pretty nice?—and is overloaded with exposition. Granted, CRA is partly pure big-screen fantasy, which is A-OK with a softie like me. (Did I get teary during that first-class proposal scene? MAYBE.) But at times I longed for conversations between the characters that didn’t involve them reiterating the past few years of their lives for the audience. I wanted more scenes along the lines of the dumpling tutorial, or even the food-stand binge: relaxed, revealing, and a lot less hand-holdy.\\n\\nWatercutter: Side note: Anyone remember when Chu and his Step Up 2 crew got into a YouTube dance battle with Miley Cyrus?\\n\\nCeres: What, how did I miss this?! Adding to the YouTube queue, stat.\\n\\nWatercutter: It ended with a battle at the Teen Choice Awards, but before that everyone from Lindsay Lohan to Adam Sandler got involved. Anyway, sorry to distract. Carry on.\\n\\nCeres: I agree with Brian’s point on extraneous subplots. That had bothered me about the book, and the movie adaptation seemed like a missed opportunity to prune some exposition in favor of fully realizing its characters. One secondary character’s arc, in particular, had so much potential to complicate this extravagant world, but the film moves at such a clip that we couldn’t fully appreciate it.\\n\\nPham: Brian, that proposal scene was top-notch, but I think it happened while they were still in budget economy, no? (Sorry, I had to.)\\n\\nAlso, I have to admit that I initially wasn’t planning to see this in the theater. Despite being a fan of romantic comedies, I never really make a conscious decision to see them in theaters, let alone on opening weekend. I think the first and last time I ever said “I have to go see this” about a movie in this ballpark was Hitch, all the way back in 2005. The same people I know who are glad for some Asian representation onscreen are also the ones that commiserate with me about the lack of good rom-coms. Double win. What about, you, Angela—what were your thoughts coming away from all this?\\n\\nWatercutter: I think you all got at most of what I felt about this movie. To your point, Phuc, I hope that this is the start of something. I hope it gets a lot more movies from Asian filmmakers greenlit so that a wider variety of stories can be told.\\n\\nNow, can I ask an unrelated question? What was everyone’s favorite scene/joke/bit? I mean, I think the mah-jongg scene is going to end up being the one people think about when they think about Crazy Rich Asians years from now, but what else stood out for you guys? For me, I think I laughed the hardest when Jeong called Awkwafina “Ellen,” presumably because of her short blonde ’do. In a movie full of great moments, what were your faves?\\n\\nRaftery: I think Ken Jeong’s just-slightly-off dad—who’s in the movie for just a few minutes—gave the film a comic unpredictability it needed at times, to break up some of the constant backstory logjams. (He was also one of the few characters without any hang-ups, dramas, or big challenges to deal with, which may be why he came off as so relaxed.) He’s really one of the great supporting comedy players of the ’00s, and yet I can’t remember the last time he was so comfortably loosey-goosey as he is here.\\n\\nPham: I’ve been consumed with the idea of Asian masculinity lately: How is it defined? In what ways does it manifest itself? Is it possible to correct for misrepresentation in a way that feels genuine, wholesome, and not ultrabro? Jimmy O. Yang’s character and his over-the-top “boys’ club” bachelor party is pretty representative of the approach of many men who seek advice on r/AsianMasculinity. So seeing Golding and Chris Pang steal away from all that to a secluded beach in order to discuss anxieties surrounding marriage and the future really resonated with me. Sure, their naked abs do something for Asian male representation, but to see the two of them talk candidly about serious feelings-type things reminded me of the men in my life whose support and advice I treasure.\\n\\nCeres: The opening song gave me goosebumps! The first strain of music you hear in the film is this old-Hollywood big band intro. Then the vocalist comes in … and the song is in Mandarin! The first track, “Waiting for Your Return,” is a Chinese jazz classic, delivered with renewed verve and glamor by vocalist Jasmine Chen. It’s a thrilling opening for a thoughtfully curated soundtrack, interspersed with Chinese classics along with covers of American pop songs in Mandarin and Cantonese.\\n\\nI now listen to the soundtrack religiously. When I walk into the office with my headphones in, know that I’m fueling up on confidence from “我的新衣 My New Swag” by Chinese rapper VaVa (feat. Ty. and Nina Wang), and that you shouldn’t mess with me during that time.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'This story originally appeared on The New Republic and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Germany was supposed to be a model for solving global warming. In 2007, the country’s government announced that it would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by the year 2020. This was the kind of bold, aggressive climate goal scientists said was needed in all developed countries. If Germany could do it, it would prove the target possible. So far, Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 27.7 percent—an astonishing achievement for a developed country with a highly developed manufacturing sector. But with a little more than a year left to go, despite dedicating $580 billion toward a low-carbon energy system, the country “is likely to fall short of its goals for reducing harmful carbon-dioxide emissions,” Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. And the reason for that may come down not to any elaborate solar industry plans, but something much simpler: cars. “At the time they set their goals, they were very ambitious,” Patricia Espinosa, the United Nations’ top climate change official, told Bloomberg. “What happened was that the industry—particularly the car industry—didn’t come along.” Changing the way we power our homes and businesses is certainly important. But as Germany’s shortfall shows, the only way to achieve these necessary, aggressive emissions reductions to combat global warming is to overhaul the gas-powered automobile and the culture that surrounds it. The only question left is how to do it.\\n\\nIn 2010, a NASA study declared that automobiles were officially the largest net contributor of climate change pollution in the world. “Cars, buses, and trucks release pollutants and greenhouse gases that promote warming, while emitting few aerosols that counteract it,” the study read. “In contrast, the industrial and power sectors release many of the same gases—with a larger contribution to [warming]—but they also emit sulfates and other aerosols that cause cooling by reflecting light and altering clouds.” In other words, the power generation sector may have emitted the most greenhouse gases in total. But it also released so many sulfates and cooling aerosols that the net impact was less than the automobile industry, according to NASA. Since then, developed countries have cut back on those cooling aerosols for the purpose of countering regular air pollution, which has likely increased the net climate pollution of the power generation industry. But according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, “collectively, cars and trucks account for nearly one-fifth of all U.S. emissions,” while “in total, the US transportation sector—which includes cars, trucks, planes, trains, ships, and freight—produces nearly thirty percent of all US global warming emissions ... .” In fact, transportation is now the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States—and it has been for two years, according to an analysis from the Rhodium Group. There’s a similar pattern happening in Germany. Last year, the country’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased as a whole, “largely thanks to the closure of coal-fired power plants,” according to Reuters. Meanwhile, the transportation industry’s emissions increased by 2.3 percent, “as car ownership expanded and the booming economy meant more heavy vehicles were on the road.” Germany’s transportation sector remains the nation’s second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but if these trends continue, it will soon become the first. Clearly, the power generation industry is changing its ways. So why aren’t carmakers following suit?',\n",
       " 'One of my favorite classes to teach is Physics for Elementary Education. It\\'s a physics class designed to address the needs of future elementary school teachers—grades 1 through 6 or so. To guide the class, I\\'ve been using a version of Next Gen Physical Science and Everyday Thinking for a long time, maybe 13 years or so, and it is super awesome.\\n\\nOne of the major goals in this course is to help students understand the nature of science—in particular the idea that science is all about building and testing models. Throughout the course, the students collect data and build models of their own, but they also learn about existing scientific models, like the heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system.\\n\\nBut there\\'s a problem with just going ahead and assuming that the Earth orbits the sun. For a long time, humans believed in a different model of the solar system: the geocentric, or Earth-centered model. How do we know today which model is correct—or importantly, how can you know it\\'s the best model? Do we just have to rely on what the textbooks tell us?\\n\\nThe answer is no. I am going to go over three things you can observe (using simple tools) to support the idea of a heliocentric model of the solar system. Who needs to depend on those silly textbooks when you can figure stuff out yourself?\\n\\nPhases of Venus\\n\\nJamie Cooper/SSPL/Getty Images\\n\\nFor this observation, you are going to need a pair of binoculars and some time. Step one is to find out when Venus (the planet) is visible from your location. A quick Google search should give you the answer. If it\\'s not up in the sky right now, just wait a few weeks and you should be able to see it again (without having to get up at 4 AM).\\n\\nWhen you look at Venus with the binoculars, you should notice something. First, it\\'s clearly not a star. Second, it\\'s not even circular. The shape of Venus should be similar to the phases of the moon—that\\'s because Venus has phases. Yes, you can have a \"crescent\" looking shape to Venus.\\n\\nBut what does this mean about the geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system? First, let\\'s recall what causes the phases of the moon—here is a refresher. In short, half of the moon is illuminated by the sun. Since we look at the moon from different angles, we only see part of the illuminated half of the moon and this causes the phases. The exact same thing is true for Venus.\\n\\nSo, if Venus has a crescent-shaped phases, that means that we are looking at the \"back side\" of Venus. If Venus has a full phase, we are looking at the \"front side.\" The only way for this to happen is if Venus orbits the sun. But wait! That doesn\\'t mean the solar system has to be heliocentric. It\\'s still possible that the Earth is at the center and the sun orbits the Earth but Venus orbits the sun. It would be weird—but it\\'s possible.\\n\\nMoons of Jupiter\\n\\nNASA Goddard\\n\\nHere is another thing you can see with a pair of binoculars. Take a look at Jupiter (when it\\'s visible in the sky). If you haven\\'t ever tried this—you need to do this. Trust me. It\\'s pretty awesome. You won\\'t really be able to make out details about the planet Jupiter, but you can see the four big moons. Yes, you can see the moons of Jupiter with binoculars.\\n\\nBut what do these Jupiter moons say about the model of the solar system? Just like the phases of Venus, this doesn\\'t prove that the geocentric model is wrong. However, it is obvious that these moons are orbiting Jupiter and not the Earth. So, Earth isn\\'t the center of everything.\\n\\nRetrograde Motion of Mars\\n\\nThis one is classic—and you don\\'t even need a telescope or anything. You only need some patience. Here\\'s what you do. Go outside at night and notice the location of Mars with respect to the background stars. Do this again the next night and you will notice that it is in a different location (with respect to the background stars). In fact, all of the planets do this—that\\'s how we know they aren\\'t stars.\\n\\nBut if you keep tracking the motion of Mars you will notice that it moves to the east—except for some special times. Occasionally Mars will move west for short time before once again moving east. This is called retrograde motion.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s consider the geocentric model with Mars orbiting the Earth. Every night it would move farther to the east. That makes sense. But how do you explain the times when it moves to the west? That\\'s just crazy.\\n\\nOK, just for fun I\\'m going to make a model of the Mars retrograde motion. If you plot the position of the planet every day, it would look something like this. Note: These aren\\'t real numbers, it\\'s just an example.\\n\\nThe angular position of Mars (fake Mars) keeps increasing from -90 degrees to 90 degrees (and then back to negative 90). This happens until around fake time of 10 (fake time units). Notice that for a short time Mars moves back the other way—boom. That\\'s retrograde motion.\\n\\nNow here is the planetary motion that would make this plot. If you need to re-run this model (in python), just click the \"play button.\"\\n\\nIn this model, both the Earth and Mars orbit a sun—please realize that this model is not to scale. Really, nothing is correct except that the force that causes the orbit is an inverse square law force (just like real gravity). This means that the angular velocity for the planets decreases with orbital distance. The Earth orbits \"faster\" than Mars. It is this region in which the Earth overtakes Mars that we get retrograde motion.\\n\\nUsing a heliocentric model makes for a simple explanation of the retrograde motion of Mars. But again, that doesn\\'t \"prove\" the heliocentric model. But if you take all three of these experiments together you have two options (OK, you could find even more options if you wanted). Option A: The Earth and Mars both orbit the sun. Option B: Mars and the sun orbit the Earth but Mars has a non-circular or some type of funky orbit. Also, Venus still orbits the sun. Option A just seems simpler. Let\\'s go with a heliocentric model of the solar system.\\n\\nAn Argument for Geocentric\\n\\nJust to be clear. Before you did these three experiments (which I\\'m sure you did), it\\'s not such a crazy idea to stick with the geocentric model. If you had never looked at a textbook or watched a YouTube video, would you think the Earth orbits the sun? I think not. It certainly doesn\\'t seem that the Earth is both spinning on its axis once a day as well as moving at 30 kilometers per second (the speed needed to get all the way around the sun in just one year).\\n\\nWouldn\\'t we fly off a spinning Earth? Wouldn\\'t birds have trouble flying to keep up with the Earth? In fact, it just doesn\\'t feel like the Earth is moving. The geocentric model of the solar system is completely reasonable until you start to collect better data. Or, to say this with respect to the Nature of Science: Some models are pretty good until you collect more data that says they aren\\'t good. That is the way science works.\\n\\nEven though there is evidence to support a heliocentric model, historically, there was still one very big problem with it. If the Earth is moving around the sun, then there should be an apparent shift of the positions of stars. This is called stellar parallax. Parallax is the thing your phone uses to place virtual objects in the camera view (like ARkit in Apple\\'s iOS). It turns out that it is super difficult to detect stellar parallax. Stars are very far away so that their shift is too small to notice with crappy telescopes. Better telescopes got us better data, which got us a better model of the solar system.\\n\\nAnother example: the Foucault pendulum. This is basically a long pendulum that changes its plane of oscillation due to the rotation of the Earth. It\\'s difficult to set up so I skipped it up above. But if you bother to build one, you\\'ll get even better data supporting the heliocentric model of the solar system.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'Of all the striking things about the interview with Elon Musk The New York Times published Thursday night—the tears, the lack of regrets over certain tweets, the fact that rapper Azealia Banks may somehow be part of Tesla’s financial future—was Musk’s claim that he’d be ready to abandon his role as Tesla CEO and chairman.\\n\\n“If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job,” he told the paper. “Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.”\\n\\nOn the surface, the implication—nobody else can do this—is nonsense. Lots of people could run Tesla. Starting with the hundreds of capable executives at the world’s automakers, most of which are larger, more efficient, and more profitable than Tesla. Go a bit deeper though, and you find the truth of the sentiment. Sure, someone might be a better CEO. But there’s no replacing Elon Musk. Because the man is not just a CEO. To many, the man is a legend.\\n\\nStart with the tale of Tesla. When the company launched in 2003, car salesmen were stocking up on the 12-mpg Hummer H2. The most popular battery-powered vehicles were golf carts. The American auto industry is famously brutal to newcomers, and the idea of one succeeding with electric vehicles racked up the lolz. For years, skeptics waited to bury Tesla alongside Tucker, DeLorean, Fisker. Musk defied them. He made electric cars capable (and sort of self-driving). He made them easy to charge (on an infrastructure he built). But most importantly, he made them desirable. Owning a Tesla became a status symbol; about 400,000 people are on a waiting list to own the Model 3. The entire venture proved you didn’t have to be GM or Ford or Chrysler to make cars in America. And you didn’t have to be BMW or Mercedes or Lexus to make luxury cars appealing to Americans.\\n\\nSimultaneously, Musk was running SpaceX. Under his leadership, the commercial space company defied entrenched aviation giants like Boeing by breaking into the rocket science business. Musk promised to colonize Mars. As his side hustles, he wished a hyperloop industry into creation, dabbled in artificial intelligence, and won a contract to dig tunnels under Chicago.\\n\\nAnd all along the way, much of the world cheered him on. Musk graced magazine covers. He inspired songs. He went on talk shows, appeared on The Simpsons and South Park, made Page Six headlines. Sure, he had a sizable ego (who wouldn’t?) and habit of belittling those who doubted or opposed him (haters!), but the public largely forgave him these minor transgressions given his major skills in proposing big, bold ideas, and delivering on them.\\n\\nBut over the past year, this goodwill has started to fade. Much of that erosion can be traced to Musk’s greatest business struggle: the mass production of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. The car Tesla had long promised, the vehicle that would bring clean driving to the masses and profits to shareholders, that would make Tesla a real automaker. As ever, Musk set ambitious goals and deadlines. As ever, he missed them. A few times over. Investors were used to this, but the company’s future hinged on the Model 3, a reality that evidently intensified the pressure, especially as the production process hit one snag after another. “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” Musk told the Times. “It was excruciating.” He didn’t contain the pain. In the first half of 2018, he raged at the media, insulted financial analysts during a public call with investors, and attacked the National Transportation Safety Board—the Mr. Rogers of federal agencies.\\n\\nThen, in the final week of June, at the very end of the second quarter, Tesla finally hit its goal of building more than 5,000 Model 3s in a single week (5,031, to be exact), the point at which Musk believes revenue from sales will outweigh the cost of production, and lead to profitability. The automaker has started to offer more versions of the car, indicating it was confident it could keep up the pace. Investors’ confidence in Musk seemed, at long last, justified.\\n\\nIt should have eased the pressure. But Musk kept finding himself the center of unwanted attention. In July, he railed against those saying his efforts to assist in the rescue of a group of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand were more self-aggrandizing than serious. When a diver who helped with the effort insulted him, Musk called him “pedo guy.” (He later apologized.) The same week, he struggled to explain why he donated about $40,000 to a Republican political action committee, given that many Republicans are climate change deniers. None of this inspired confidence in Musk, but Model 3s kept coming off the production line. Investors will forgive a lot if they make their money.\\n\\nLast week, though, Musk’s erratic behavior and his taste for Twitter struck a blow not just to his reputation, but to his company. On Tuesday, he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private, and he had the necessary funding “secured.” The automaker’s stock price shot up, as did eyebrows at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Especially when Musk revealed a few days later that by “secured,” he meant not exactly secured. The SEC is investigating, and serious fines are a possibility. Angered investors have filed four lawsuits—so far. “As a result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements, as well as their market manipulation, Tesla securities purchasers were injured to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,” one reads.\\n\\nThe pressure to perform has eased, but its effects, it seems, endure. Musk cares deeply about what people think of him and his companies. His harsh reactions to negative press often beget more of the same, a surely unsettling shift from the years of mostly adoring coverage he received, of the publicly validated self-worth he must have come to expect. And while he retains a loyal army of Twitter followers, his mantle as a Renaissance Superman, gifted by an enthralled public—and media—is slipping.\\n\\nIn his interview with the Times, Musk said that in terms of Tesla’s operations, the worst is over. “But from a personal pain standpoint,” he said, “the worst is yet to come.” This bodes ill not just for his investors, but for everyone who thinks cars should be fun to drive and good for the planet, who wants to explore space, who believes in a better future.\\n\\nMusk, then, is Hercules remixed. The greatest of Greek heroes performed his famed labors as penance for killing his children in a fit of insanity. Musk has completed his own labors, landing rockets on boats and delivering a wonderful, affordable, electric car. But the effort seems to have left him mad. And now he threatens to destroy what he has created.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'Tesla is no ordinary automaker, and Elon Musk is no ordinary CEO. He makes grand bets and pronouncements, gets cornered by TMZ, and injects himself into spats with other tech luminaries. Occasionally, lawyers get involved.\\n\\nIn the past month or so, a lot of lawyers have gotten involved. On August 7, the Tesla CEO tweeted that he was considering taking his company private, and that he had secured the funding to do so. The latter may not have been completely true, which has drawn the attention of shareholders and federal regulators alike.\\n\\nMeanwhile, ex-employees have filed two whistle-blower complaints with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging retaliation and the coverup of a drug ring. Others say they were improperly fired from the company, or that it improperly interfered with potential board members. And at least four Tesla shareholders have accused the company of fraud and market manipulation—and one wants everyone who purchased Tesla securities after that tweet to join his case. Meanwhile, the SEC has reportedly opened a probe into Musk’s Twitter activity; the commission served the electric car maker with subpoenas on last week.\\n\\nThere is a lot happening, and with the fate of Tesla far from certain, it’s a good moment to pause and run through some of the wildest allegations thrown about in the last three months, which fall on a spectrum from “yeesh” to “yikes” to “Holy Mother of God.” Of course, these lawsuits are all based on allegations at this point. Nothing has been proven yet, and lawsuits tend to come with the territory when you’re running a big company. These will (likely) play out slowly, and hopefully with heapings of thoughtful deliberation and hard evidence, within the justice system. But in the meantime, expect them to serve as frustrating mountains (or mole hills) to scale as the company continues to work on ramping up its vehicle production.\\n\\nThe Martin Tripp Complaint\\n\\nOn July 11, a former Tesla technician named Martin Tripp filed a whistle-blower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging Tesla had lied to investors about production numbers and knowingly used damaged batteries and scrapped parts in its cars. Tesla denies the allegations, and says it fired Tripp for leaking information to reporters, stealing trade secrets, and hacking into the company’s computer systems. In June, it sued Tripp for hacking and trade secret theft.\\n\\nLast week, Tripp tweeted out internal photos and emails that he says corroborate his claims. The former employee deleted his Twitter account a day later.\\n\\nIn a statement to WIRED, a Tesla spokesperson called the claims false: “Mr. Tripp does not even have personal knowledge about the safety claims that he is making. No punctured cells have ever been used in any Model 3 vehicles in any way, and all VINs that have been identified have safe batteries. Notably, there have been zero battery safety issues in any Model 3.”\\n\\nKarl Hansen Complaint\\n\\nLast Thursday, another former member of Tesla’s internal security department filed a whistle-blower complaint with the SEC, and this one—if you can believe it—is even stranger. Karl Hansen alleges that the electric car maker failed to inform its shareholders and law enforcement that it had uncovered an employee-run drug trafficking scheme out of its Nevada Gigafactory battery plant.\\n\\nIn a summary of the complaint reviewed by Jalopnik, Hansen wrote that in May, the Drug Enforcement Administration informed the automaker that “a Tesla employee may be a participant in a narcotics trafficking ring involving the sale of significant quantities of cocaine and possibly crystal methamphetamine at the Gigafactory on behalf of a Mexican drug cartel from Sonora, Mexico.” (In a statement, the DEA told BuzzFeed it “does not notify non-law enforcement entities of ongoing or pending investigations.”) Hansen says he told Tesla that he had confirmed this law enforcement tip in mid-June, but that the company did not inform board members or the public.\\n\\n“This guy is super [peanut emoji],” Musk told Gizmodo in a Twitter direct message. “He is simultaneously saying that our security sucks (it’s not great, but I’m pretty sure we aren’t a branch of the Sinaloa cartel like he claims) and that we have amazing spying ability. Those can’t both be true.”\\n\\nA Tesla spokesperson told WIRED the company took Hansen’s allegations “very seriously,” that some are false, and that when it tried to corroborate his claims, Hansen was unresponsive. “We made numerous attempts to engage further with Mr. Hansen to understand more about what he was claiming and the work that he did in reaching his conclusions. He rejected each of those attempts, and to date has refused to speak with the company further,” the spokesperson said.\\n\\nShareholder Lawsuits\\n\\nLast week, Musk sent Tesla shares a’bouncing when he suddenly announced on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private, and that he had secured the funding to do so. But over the course of the next few days, it became clear that the funding wasn’t quite secure. So on August 10, a short seller named Kalman Isaacs filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk and Tesla on behalf of everyone who bought Tesla securities after the tweet. Isaacs’ complaint alleges that Musk meant to lie—that he knew funding wasn’t secured but hoped to squeeze the short sellers who so frustrate him. “As a result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements, as well as their market manipulation, Tesla securities purchasers were injured to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,” the lawsuit, filed in the Northern District Court of California, reads. Other shareholders have filed at least three similar lawsuits, all in the same California court and seeking restitution for funds lost during early August’s market rollercoaster. (Tesla shares climbed 11 percent following Musk’s twitter announcement but have since fallen, especially after Musk granted a glum and emotional interview with The New York Times.) A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.\\n\\nCarlos Ramirez\\n\\nIn June, Tesla’s former director of environmental, health, safety, and sustainability, a man named Carlos Ramirez, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination. According to his suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California, Ramirez alleges he uncovered flaws in the company’s incident reporting system at its Fremont, California, plant, including “numerous instances of lack of treatment of Tesla employees that suffered workplace injuries, recordkeeping violations, and improper classification of workplace injuries to avoid treating and reporting workplace injuries.” Ramirez’s complaint claims that he alerted Tesla management to these issues, but that the company ignored them, failed to notify the public or state agencies, and then fired him weeks later.\\n\\nTesla says Ramirez was not fired for reporting the system flaws, but instead for inappropriate workplace conduct. “It was clear that he had engaged over and over again in harassing workplace behavior and used extremely inappropriate language that violated any reasonable standard,” a Tesla spokesperson said in an extensive statement, published in full by Jalopnik. Representatives for Tesla and Ramirez are set to meet before a judge in late October.\\n\\nThe SEC\\n\\nWhen Elon Musk posted that “funding secured” tweet earlier this month, he not only launched himself into the crosshairs of litigious shareholders—he also reportedly caught the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal agency is said to be looking into the circumstances surrounding the tweet, as well as Tesla’s take-private scheme, and reportedly issued Tesla subpoenas last week.\\n\\nTo be sure, many investigations don’t result in charges. But should the SEC choose to do so, it could sanction or sue the electric car maker for fraud or even market manipulation, according to John Coffee Jr., a Columbia Law School professor who studies corporations and securities regulation. If the SEC does bring a suit, experts say Musk and Co. are better off settling quickly, because a loss in court could mean writing million-dollar paychecks. Indeed, Fox Business reports that the tweet has already cost Tesla big bucks, millions in fees to law firms.\\n\\nIt’s yet another thing for a busy electric car maker to deal with, as it tries to reshape the world.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"Rolling into San Francisco’s new bus terminal has all the vibes of docking with a Googie space station—the weird, special bridge into the hangar, the orange color accents behind a white superstructure, glowing information screens everywhere. The hieroglyphically obtuse wayfinding signage only adds to the effect. I may have gotten on a bus in the East Bay, but I’m disembarking on Space Station V, in transit to Clavius.\\n\\nThat’s no moon. It’s the “Salesforce Transit Center” (owing to a naming-rights deal with the company that owns the skyscraper next door), a $2.26 billion hub for the city’s Muni buses, as well as buses from across the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges—and Greyhound. Some day, if all goes as planned, it’ll be where California’s commuter and high-speed rail lines arrive in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe station is a white whale eight years in the making (and that’s just the construction bit), a crystalline Moby Dick with Penrose-tile skin breaching the downtown grid and drafting the psychogeographic currents around glass-and-steel towers. I like it; San Francisco feels new there, and even though a building that’s aesthetically to my taste might not be to yours, there’s urban glory in bustle, in elegant skyways and in clotted mazes of streets opening onto a broad pedestrian plaza. I like the aluminum screen, and I like the orange walls inside, though I’m suspicious about how well they’ll age as color fashions change and urban soot and fungus go looking for new substrate. The big, main open space of the station has a beautiful tile floor under a grand light well, and its high escalator makes it feel like a place where a human can make a big entrance or a big exit. If you don’t have a downtown cathedral, at least you can have a downtown transit station.\\n\\nThe station isn’t complete. Street-level spaces I assume will be for retail and restaurants haven’t opened yet. Workers are still finishing planters and sidewalks. An entire floor that’ll be a food court is still bare concrete. So it’s hard to know whether the station will do all the things that a grand transit node does in other cities—a Gare du Nord or a Shinjuku. It has no shops yet, no place to buy a beer for the ride and a bouquet for your honey, food for dinner, a pair of reading glasses, a magazine (OK, no one buys those), an aspirin. Nobody is playing drums on plastic buckets next to an escalator. There are no homeless people, and the almost total absence of places to sit suggests an attempt to design them out of existence.\\n\\nI’m being intentionally unfair here; Gare du Nord sees 700,000 people a day and Shinjuku more than 3.5 million. The Transbay’s peak capacity is 24,000. This is a small-town station with big-city ambitions. But the thing is, when you start to ask questions about what the station does not have, they multiply. It aspires to be a beating heart for the city, but this “Grand Central of the West” isn’t connected to the rest of the circulatory system.\\n\\nThe $2.26 billion transportation complex looks lovely: a crystalline Moby Dick with Penrose-tile skin breaching the downtown grid and drafting the psychogeographic currents around glass-and-steel towers. Karl Mondon/Digital First Media/Getty Images\\n\\nAfter the ride down that escalator, the experience slides from grand to confusing. Wayfinding signs give general directions—Muni this way, Amtrak over there—but without the specificity that could help get travelers from this bit of the city to the rest. San Francisco’s grand Ferry Building, itself a transbay transit hub, is half a mile away, a 10 minute walk. Not only is there no direct connection from the Transit Center, there’s not even signage indicating how to get from one to the other, nor a protected bike path.\\n\\n(That’s another question that demands more questions. With all the sidewalk-rending construction of the past decade downtown, how is there no protected bike path from the Caltrain commuter rail station to the Salesforce Transit Center? For that matter, how is there no protected bike path connecting the Ferry Building to the Golden Gate Bridge?)\\n\\nThe broad plaza I like on the transit center’s south side—it’ll be a bigger park eventually, and it already has food trucks—connects to narrow little Natoma Street. That's where the bike lockers and bike-share dock are (until phase two puts them under the terminal), and what has become, with the terminal’s opening, the luckiest bar in the city. Keep walking on Natoma, and if you can manage to get across busy New Montgomery (there’s no light or crosswalk), you get to amble down what another town might call a paseo, and might even put little stalls for coffee and tchotchkes in, if citizens on foot were allowed to enjoy themselves. That puts you at a hidden inside elbow of the new SF Museum of Modern Art, a cute secret courtyard that angles you out toward another little paseo … across a multiple-lane street without a crosswalk. There are planters that try to keep you from attempting the jaywalk. I do it anyway.\\n\\nOh, but the hilarious part: Turn right at those planters and you see you are a block away from San Francisco’s nearly-completed, newly rebuilt convention center. Yes! An easy, sub-10-minute, mostly car-free walk connects the Transit Center to one of the city’s major destinations. This, apparently, is a mildly dangerous secret. Presumably it won’t remain that way, because in a month basically everyone in that adjacent naming-rights skyscraper will be walking that way to get to the annual Dreamforce conference—last year it hosted more than 170,000 people. Expect a lot of jaywalking.\\n\\nThe ride down the escalator is grand. Then things get confusing. Karl Mondon/Digital First Media/Getty Images\\n\\nPhase two of construction on the project aims to more firmly embed the terminal in the city’s fabric. The heavy rail lines that today end at a station about a mile south will go underground and stop in the Transbay’s basement. An 800-foot tunnel will connect that basement to a subway station a block and a half away that also serves San Francisco’s electric trolley line and abuts a cable car stop. The timeline for all that is somewhere between “inshallah” and “alas.”\\n\\nThe missed-connections theme picks back up with the Transit Center’s marquee feature, its rooftop park. Salesforce Park is open to the public and includes nearly 5.5 acres of grass, undulating hills, and some really interesting plantings that represent different California biomes, with good signage explaining what’s what. The green space doubles as gray-water treatment for the building, and it enfolds performance spaces, carts with games to play, coffee carts, seating areas … look, it’s pretty charming. Cities too often force a binary choice between being street-level or up high. Salesforce Park literally forces you to have a new perspective on San Francisco; a walk in the park means being able to look into the windows of the adjacent office buildings, and I like being at eye level with their giant light-up signs. Of course, some local wags have dubbed the park “San Francisco’s High Line.” (Every time a West Coast city names some feature after one in New York I lose more ground in my war to make the East Coast irrelevant.)\\n\\nBut like the High Line, the Transit Center is less a park and more a walled garden. It is access-controlled. Two adjacent buildings have their own entrances; other than that, you have to go up through the terminal or, when it’s finished, ride a (very cool looking) cable car up from street level.\\n\\nThis only matters programmatically. Which is to say, controlling access controls the uses of the park. There will never be a political demonstration in Salesforce Park. There will never be unapproved buskers. The trees and grass don’t touch the ground; their roots are literally up in the air. The park is open to the public, but it is not a public park, if you see what I mean.\\n\\nWould I rather the Transit Center had captured its aerial value some other way? A residential tower/hotel on one side, a commercial skyscraper on the other? Yeah, I probably would like that, because I am the kind of person who thinks Shinjukus and Gare du Nords are more than emblems. I love the form of the Salesforce Transit Center. I just wish it were following more functions.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'Nick Millington had just started to feel like a successful software engineer. It was early 2003, and at age 26 he already had a fruitful career at Microsoft. He feared his one-bedroom apartment in Redmond, Washington—filled with a mishmash of bargain-bin furniture and DIY shelving made of cinderblocks and wood planks—wasn\\'t representative of his upward mobility. He wasn\\'t a starving student anymore, he was an adult. So Millington did what we all do once we\\'re able: He bought a larger, more elegant apartment and filled it with brand-new stuff. \"I was starting to think more about the design of my home,\" Millington says. \"You know, upgrading to the fancier Ikea furniture that looked nice.\" Sonos chief product officer Nick Millington. Sonos One nagging problem was how to rig up his music system. Digital music was exploding on the internet, and Millington had spent many hours methodically trying to collect every Billboard Top 40 hit from 1945 onward, amassing a wide range of other, more eclectic music files along the way. But listening to his treasure trove of tunes felt like living in the dorms again. All of his MP3s were stored on the boxy PC he kept in his living room. \"At the time, my music setup was a Gateway 2000 tower PC and then I had a laptop,\" he says. \"I would do terminal server into the PC and play MP3 files there. That wasn\\'t cutting it for me.\" Around that same time, a Santa Barbara, California, startup called Sonos was hiring engineers. Sonos courted Millington with a simple pitch: It wanted to make digital music players that would look respectable on his \"fancier\" Ikea shelves, wirelessly access his MP3s without requiring him to touch a PC, and play all of his music in every room of his house. Millington wanted in. Now, 15 years later, Nick Millington is the chief product officer at Sonos: the guy responsible for all of the company\\'s speakers and software. When I meet him at Sonos\\' East Coast headquarters in Boston, he\\'s dressed like an archetypical engineer, in a plaid, short-sleeved shirt. Framing his round face is brown hair that\\'s kept in check but seems to be waiting for the chance to poof and curl. He looks both completely put together and a dash disheveled all at once. Millington is named as an inventor on 69 Sonos patents, with 33 others pending—a significant portion of the company\\'s entire portfolio, which numbers around 500 patents. He also developed the core networking framework that keeps the playback of multiple Sonos speakers throughout a home in perfect sync. His work was central to the company\\'s early adoption of apps and its expansion from amps to speakers. Yet, even though his efforts have proven critical to the company\\'s success, Millington tends to credit others a lot more than himself. He seems more concerned with solving problems than bragging about his solutions, which may be why he\\'s never sought a greater spotlight or given an in-depth interview before talking to WIRED. Since 2005, Sonos has sold 19 million audio devices—each of them a representation of the work done by Millington and his team—into 7 million homes. The same speakers still top many best-of guides. By most measures, it\\'s a story of success. In the future, Millington hints, Sonos may create its first speakers and audio products designed to leave the house. But today, Sonos is sailing rougher seas. Cofounder and CEO John MacFarlane resigned in early 2017 and was replaced by COO Patrick Spence. The company has also had more than one round of layoffs as it has dealt with an evolving competitive landscape. The rise of the voice-assistant smart speaker, in particular, took the company by surprise. Just this year, shortly before going public, Sonos released a new soundbar that interacts with voice services from Apple, Amazon, and soon, Google—the same tech giants who have charged forcefully into the multiroom wireless speaker market Sonos built. It will be up to Millington and his product team to chart a course through the choppy, frenemy-filled waters ahead. To do it, he may help guide the company into new places altogether. Until now, all Sonos products have been shackled to rooms inside your home. In the future, Millington hints, Sonos may create its first speakers and audio products designed to leave the house.\\n\\nMillington is used to leaving houses. As the son of a British Diplomatic Service officer, he spent his entire childhood globetrotting, but it was his time as a kid in Japan in the 1980s—an era when the country was the worldwide epicenter for electronic innovation—that set him on a path toward tech. \"There was an area of Tokyo called Akihabara, which is where there were all of these tech companies and these stores where you could go buy endless arrays of parts, and incredibly cheap floppy disks and all sorts of equipment,\" Millington says. \"I used to go almost every weekend with a few geeky friends of mine and check out various developments and things like that.\" He learned about networking early on as well, subscribing to the first dialup internet service provider in Japan, called TWICS. He ran a Tokyo PC users group on a bulletin board system that predated the web. Eventually, he landed at Duke University in the US and then went to Microsoft when he graduated in 1998, where he worked on SharePoint, the software maker\\'s online collaboration platform. When Sonos was founded, in 2002, there was no streaming music. No Spotify. No Pandora. AOL dialup was the most popular way to access the internet, and many families didn\\'t even have Wi-Fi yet. iTunes was popularizing the concept of legal music downloads, and file-sharing services like Kazaa were growing in popularity as the music industry reeled in the wake of Napster. Buying Guide: Which Sonos Speaker Should You Buy? The four founders of Sonos, led by MacFarlane, recognized that digital music would increasingly become a bigger part of consumer\\'s lives. Their big idea was an ambitious plan to make it possible for anyone to set up a multiroom home speaker network for digital music. At the time, multiroom systems could be purchased, but they were inaccessible. \"The technology was very cumbersome,\" Millington says. \"It was difficult to set up. It was typically the domain of high-end installers charging very high prices for stuff that didn\\'t always work terribly well. Sometimes you had to actually rebuild your home to put in the necessary wiring and speakers.\" Their plan was to democratize the whole stack. Instead of requiring dedicated wiring or a team of professional installers, Sonos would create Wi-Fi amplifiers (\"ZonePlayers\") that you could tether to the speakers you already owned. Set a Sonos amp in any room of your house, and digital music could be summoned from your computer using a dedicated wireless remote control. You\\'d be able to move your speaker setup to new rooms, alter which speakers were grouped together, and take the whole arrangement with you if you bought a new home. Probes test the Wi-Fi antenna performance of a Sonos speaker. Jeffrey Van Camp By early 2003, the founders had hired Andy Schulert to head up product development. He quickly called on Millington, an old Microsoft colleague, to help solve the most daunting problem the company was facing: how to develop networking tech that would flawlessly sync multiple amplifiers together, transport music between them, and keep them connected and updated through the internet—all over Wi-Fi, which was far less mature back then. Despite having no audio experience \"except for 10 years of piano lessons,\" Millington moved to Santa Barbara and taught himself what he needed to know about audio synchronization in a matter of weeks. \"We had a saying in the early days of Sonos that if there\\'s one thing that absolutely has to work in version 1 of the software it\\'s the ability to upgrade to version 1.1,\" Millington says. \"But if there are two things that have to work, then the audio transport is definitely the core part of it. I have always liked to gravitate toward the core problem where \\'If we don\\'t solve this, we have no product\\' and make sure that it\\'s handled in the best possible way.\" Syncing amps (and their speakers) wasn\\'t easy. One of the big challenges with multiple speakers is dealing with the accuracy of the human ear, which can quickly detect audio that\\'s out of sync. \"The way that you perceive stereo [sound] is with differences in time when the signal arrives at your right ear and your left ear,\" Millington explains. \"If that is moving around or it\\'s off, it will seem like the sound is coming from a different location, and it can be quite quite disconcerting. You need to synchronize it to less than a millisecond of accuracy to have it be a really pleasurable experience.\" To get multiple speakers to sync that closely, Millington developed a method of time-stamping all the music traveling between speakers, thereby holding each speaker accountable. Timestamping made it virtually impossible for Sonos ZonePlayers to get out of sync. Want to give Alexa an audio upgrade? Read our review of the Sonos One smart speaker. The team made another important choice around this time. Instead of designating a permanent master ZonePlayer that centrally ran the entire network, the team created a distributed network in which every Player acted on its own and intelligently communicated with the others—no easy task. For example, if a user had five ZonePlayers hooked up, Millington couldn\\'t let all five of them fetch music from the internet. It would suck up too much bandwidth and potentially crush a home network. So he developed a \"delegation\" process that allowed every ZonePlayer to dynamically assign duties to one another. If one ZonePlayer was removed from the network, another one could pick up the slack and take over its duties—even fetching the music for all the Players, if necessary. Unfortunately, none of this worked over Wi-Fi yet. John MacFarlane was adamant that the whole system work wirelessly, so Millington turned to mesh networking. This method offers a way to wirelessly connect devices in an ad hoc fashion, so you don\\'t need to rely on a central traffic point like a router to keep the network humming. Millington taught himself mesh networking in about six weeks. By early 2004, Sonos\\' wireless mesh networking system was working. Owners would be able to run up to 32 Sonos players in their home, grouping and ungrouping them at will to bundle rooms together, play the same music across an entire floor of their house, or use each player separately. But code that works in the lab still has to pass real-world tests. Millington and the crew began traveling to homes with different Wi-Fi setups near Sonos\\' East Coast headquarters in Boston and its West-Coast headquarters in Santa Barbara. They had to figure out what microwaves and cordless phones might do to a Sonos player under the same roof. In the early days of wireless networking, many products didn\\'t use Wi-Fi as frugally as they do today, and some were major bandwidth hogs, causing a lot of headaches for the team. It was tempting to take the easy road and blame someone\\'s Wi-Fi for everything that went wrong. But for Sonos to succeed as a product, it had to operate in less-than-ideal wireless environments, and several months of troubleshooting ensued. The intense amount of testing the team went through in that prelaunch phase has been immortalized in code; all Sonos products are packed with onboard Wi-Fi diagnostic tools that can send reports to customer service reps when speakers start having problems. Space Oddity Sonos\\' earliest products were amps, and you connected your own speakers. The company\\'s iPod-like hardware remote could control it all. Sonos The first Sonos ZonePlayer (ZP100) hit store shelves in early 2005 as part of a $1,199 bundle that included two amplifiers and a physical wireless remote controller. That wireless controller had a screen and direction pad so you could play music without a PC. Some engineers affectionately referred to it as a \"Russian iPod\" because of its chunky, jog-wheel-bedecked design. But it was useful, displaying album art and song titles on a small screen, and giving users the ability to group and ungroup speakers. The company also made a strong effort to simplify setup with three-step instructions. At launch, the ZP100 was a niche proposition. Wireless multiroom systems were entirely new. Sonos players, though cheaper than a professionally installed wired system, were still fairly expensive, and the fact that they required you to purchase your own speakers was tough to communicate to a mass audience. Hardcore audiophiles likely understood it, but many of them were already in the market for (or owned) a professional setup. Still, for a startup like Sonos, it was a promising debut. The team believed the product worked really well and was reliable, and initial sales were at least decent. As word of mouth began to spread and new ZonePlayer amps arrived, Sonos gained more attention. All-In on iPhone With the concept of networked audio proven and Sonos\\' amp business up and running, Millington was promoted to director of advanced development and architecture in 2006. In his new role, he assembled a small team of half a dozen engineers to create bold, innovative product ideas—a skunkworks team of sorts. While the rest of the company maintained and improved those wireless amps, he began working on new concepts. One of his first projects turned out to be a critical milestone for Sonos. With Millington at the helm, Sonos launched its first iPhone app in late 2008—the same year the App Store launched. The company debated whether to charge for the app (nobody knew how much apps should really cost back then) but decided to make it free. Millington credits the other founders, particularly MacFarlane, for the brisk adoption of iOS. MacFarlane\\'s \"a guy who lives three or four years in the future, and he takes for granted things that don\\'t actually exist yet, is kind of how I would describe his mindset,\" Millington tells me with a smile. \"He really gave us the push in that area.\" The app eliminated the need for a host PC or that \"Russian iPod\" wireless controller. In the years that followed, Millington and the team continued to flesh out the app and began adding direct access to music streaming services as listeners stopped hoarding MP3s on their home computer and began turning to services like Pandora, Rhapsody, and Spotify. Sonos also made a critical decision around this time that continues to define what the company is about: It chose to remain an open platform. The company decided against making its own music service and instead began working to support every audio service on the market in a completely neutral way. \"Sonos is a level playing field for these services to compete for users\\' attentions and subscriptions. We\\'ve never taken any money from a music service or promoted any one of them [over the others],\" Millington says. \"I think the services appreciate that.\" The Sonos app eventually grew to support around 100 services globally, more than any similar platform. The First Sonos Speaker The next milestone project for Millington\\'s team was a full-fledged speaker for Sonos. In early 2008, he hired an audio engineer named Chris Kallai, a self-described \"audio nut\" who had spent time at Harman and Velodyne. In its early years, Sonos focused on amplifiers instead of speakers because it seemed too difficult for an unknown brand to launch a speaker as its first product. There were a lot of established companies in the space. Executives also believed that users and reviewers tended to judge speakers differently than amps. Amps are almost always evaluated objectively. With speakers, however, each listener tends to favor their preferred sound signatures. \"There was just a lot of snake oil and folklore around which ones sound good and which ones don\\'t, and things like that,\" Millington says. \"You know the nice thing about an amplifier is you can measure whether it sounds good or not. Either it reproduces the input or it doesn\\'t, whereas with a speaker it\\'s much more subjective.\" To solve the problem, the company decided to avoid creating a \"Sonos sound\" of its own. Kallai, Millington, and others decided Sonos speakers would try to replicate what recording engineers heard in the studio as they recorded albums. They assembled a group of recording artists and engineers to help. Several notable names in music, including Rick Rubin, joined the group. (Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin and overseer of many recent Beatles remasterings, currently heads it up.) An early Sonos Play:5 speaker. Sonos With Kallai\\'s help, Sonos shipped the $399 Play:5 speaker in 2009. Millington and others described this as a turning point for the company because of how much it simplified the Sonos proposition. Combined with the new iPhone app, it was a speaker that worked out of the box and sounded fantastic. It could be used alone or be networked with as many as 31 pieces of Sonos hardware—other Play:5 speakers or older ZonePlayers. It also got more capable over time, thanks to firmware updates that downloaded and installed from the app—refreshing all speakers at once. \"In some ways you can think of [the Play:5] as the first smart speaker in the sense that it\\'s internet-connected, runs software, connects to music services, and can make music itself rather than being hooked up to an external amplifier and speakers,\" Millington says. The Play:5 earned relatively high marks from reviewers, who liked its sound and features. It helps that the Play:5 stood out among what seemed like a sea of home speakers with iPod docks or then-subpar Bluetooth radios. Let the Good Times Roll The success of products like the Play:5 and iPhone app led to a promotion for Millington. He was put in charge of the entire product department at Sonos in early 2010. Throughout the next few years, more and more music listeners began to rely on their phones to stream songs, and for anyone who liked using an app, Sonos became an attractive idea. The company enjoyed a wave of growth and recognition as a leader in multiroom audio during these years, adding speakers like the petite $200 Play:1 (the top-selling Sonos speaker) and Playbar soundbar to its lineup. Eventually, Sonos came full circle and revamped the Play:5, giving it touch controls and a modern exterior. Sonos speakers undergo testing at its Boston lab. On the table are Play:5 speakers, a Playbar, and a Playbase. On the floor are Subs, the company\\'s wireless subwoofers. Jeffrey Van Camp In early 2014, Sonos redesigned its smartphone app, adding a universal music search that let you hunt through all your music services at once. Later that year, an update eliminated the need to physically plug one of your speakers/amps into your home router to create a Sonos network. All of a sudden, every Sonos player could just connect via Wi-Fi, further simplifying setup. But at the end of 2014, things began to change. Amazon released a small voice-powered speaker called the Echo. It didn\\'t sound very good, and Sonos didn\\'t recognize it as a threat. But the Echo quietly kicked off an entirely new wave of smart speakers powered by voice control. Just as things were beginning to get comfortable, the ground beneath Millington and his team\\'s feet began to shift.\\n\\nA peek inside the Sonos lab. Sonos After I finish my multihour chat with Nick Millington in the \"Fenway\" meeting room at Sonos\\' Boston office, hardware lab manager Jim Weineck whisks me away to give me a full tour of the company\\'s labs, where products, new and old, are put through their paces. The facility is intense. Many testing chambers look like massive bank vaults from the outside, and it\\'s not uncommon to see huge foam cones protruding from the walls and ceilings. In one chamber, speakers are stress-tested by having special pink noise tones piped through them for several months at a time. Pink noise sounds a lot like white noise, but it contains frequencies that are better for testing audio systems. (I was told that, in the Santa Barbara offices, Sonos had 64 Play:1 speakers playing audio at maximum volume for 12 months straight using a custom-designed tone. This tone, called \"life test noise,\" simulates a bunch of songs across all genres at once, and pumping it through the speakers for a year can simulate 10 years of playback.) In another room the size of a walk-in freezer, a huge circular array of probes studies how well the Wi-Fi antennas in Sonos products pick up and emit a signal. A monitor shows me a 3-D Wi-Fi cloud for the Sonos Playbase, which appears to have a tough time picking up signals directly below it. Other rooms test for things like the long-term effects of extreme temperatures, static electricity and how it impacts touch controls, and unintentional radiation. On the tour, one engineer tells me Sonos speakers are packed with more antennas and connectivity tech than they actually need. The team even tries to squeeze in features that may not be used yet, knowing they might be activated in the future via a software update. Whenever Sonos releases new updates, it takes pains to make sure older hardware still works reliably. Millington and other employees say there are still ZP100s out there, serving up music in 2018 just like they did in 2005. Quite a few of them, actually. Sonos claims that 93 percent of all the players it has sold are still in use—a figure that stands out in a tech world where internet-connected products increasingly seem to die on a whim. A speaker is evaluated inside the anechoic chamber. Sonos Weineck leads me into Sonos\\' anechoic acoustic chamber, my favorite part of the tour. It\\'s a two-story vault with a door so heavy it needs to be operated electronically. Inside, the room is completely silent. The walls and ceiling are covered with bundles of foot-long, gray, triangular prisms that absorb all sound and cancel any reverberations. The floor is a trampoline-like mesh material topped with a metal wire grid. If you peer through the mesh, you can see that you\\'re suspended about 10 feet off the gray, foamy ground. In the center of the room is a pedestal where a speaker sits with an arced pole of microphones in front of it. These mics capture and map the sound that comes out of a speaker. The Sonos Beam adds voice control to your home theater. Read our review. Standing in a silent chamber is oddly unnerving. Weineck tells me that with the lights out, people start to go crazy after a few minutes in the vault because they lose all sense of space and direction. All they can hear is their own heartbeat. As soon as he tells me this, I too swear I can hear my own organs pulsating. Other areas of the facility hold Faraday cages that block outside signals to create a pure environment where Sonos can test the Wi-Fi access points of its speakers (a necessity in a building filled with hundreds of internet-connected devices). A 3-D-printing room lets designers quickly mock up new product ideas. Weineck describes a couple of rooms as \"teleconferencing on steroids\" thanks to their electronic whiteboards, highly sensitive directional microphones, and a surgical camera mounted to the ceiling. The camera is precise enough to zoom in on the threading of a screw. The Santa Barbara offices have rooms identical to these here in Boston, enabling worldwide nitpicking as teams on each coast work together to perfect the look or sound of a new speaker. Notes of humanity peek through the sterile jungle of lab equipment on concrete floors. I notice jokes posted on the walls and oddly placed toys, like a shark sitting atop test equipment, hinting that there is at least a little time for play in the audio labs. In a woodworking lab, some employees pulled a prank on an engineer\\'s tendency to meticulously label his supplies by labeling absolutely everything in the room when he was on vacation, including his sink and chair. They laughed, telling me it was to help him \"get back up to speed quickly.\" There are also Obi-Wan Kenobi photos saying \"this is not the room you\\'re looking for\" cheekily plastered on some of the more mysterious doors in the labs during my visit. Like a good stormtrooper, I move along, but I also wonder what the audio Jedi are up to in those secret labs.',\n",
       " 'Policymakers at all levels of government are struggling to thoughtfully harness data in the service of public values. Many public servants grew up in an era of firmly separate disciplines: You were either an engineer or an economist, either a programmer or a social worker, but never both. In an era in which data is everything, the risks to core democratic principles—equity, fairness, support for the most vulnerable, delivery of effective government services—caused by technological illiteracy in policymakers, and policy illiteracy in computer scientists, are staggering.\\n\\nThis has happened because traditional academic disciplines, as they currently operate, often aren\\'t designed to help students study and apply technical expertise to advance the public interest (as distinct from advancing commercial interests). Students doggedly find their own public interest paths; in fact, the digital generation now in college and graduate school craves meaningful work that will change the world. As long as they can make ends meet, they\\'ll happily work for less money in public interest jobs in government and nonprofits. But most universities haven\\'t provided pathways for these digital natives to cross-train in policy and computer science by working on real problems, or to combine expertise in data science with the capacity to think deeply about the ethical and social implications of the use of digital technology.\\n\\nSusan Crawford (@scrawford) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED, a professor at Harvard Law School, and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.\\n\\nIn traditional academic settings, every public-policy-minded technologist feels a little lonely, fruitlessly attempting to cross-register into courses that might provide a few snippets of legal and policy skills or allow them to apply their coding abilities to a real, live public problem. Landing internships and fellowships can feel like guerrilla warfare to these scrappy students. This has to change—and now a consortium of foundations and academics is looking for solutions.\\n\\nLast month, a hand-picked group of university presidents and provosts from across the country, plus a few university faculty members, met for two days at an estate-turned-conference center on Long Island to catalyze the intentional creation of a new academic field aimed at addressing precisely this gap in interdisciplinary opportunities. This new area, \"public interest technology,\" is still being defined; it encompasses designing public policy and laws with an awareness of how technology actually works, as well as ensuring that technology is being used to serve public values of fairness and equity. It means consciously thinking about the welfare of society in general, rather than the incentives of a single company.\\n\\nThe group was convened by Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, Larry Kramer, president of the Hewlett Foundation, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and CEO of New America, all of whom are deeply interested in solving the high-stakes problems of siloed training for students who want to serve, plus underequipped policymakers. The presidents and provosts, a high-minded yet deeply practical bunch, took their seats in a converted indoor equestrian training ring—think enormous elliptical conference table surrounding carpeted acreage, with a giant glass skylight overhead—listened attentively, and spoke thoughtfully. I was there, at one point walking around the inside of the ring to moderate part of the conversation. It felt like an important meeting.\\n\\nFord and Hewlett are nudging universities to commit themselves to this new field, drawing an analogy to public interest law. Not too many decades ago, there weren\\'t clear professional pathways for law students who wanted to serve the public rather than private clients, although the need for services was overwhelming. The Ford Foundation, in particular, seeded the development of clinics that gave opportunities to law students to learn to act like lawyers while still in school; a world of fellowships, internships, published research, and loan forgiveness programs funded by a host of actors followed. The foundations believe that solving the problem of inadequate public interest technology services and pathways in America similarly requires intentional cross-disciplinary curriculum development and student support. And they don\\'t intend to fund all of this themselves; they are cajoling universities to concentrate their fund-raising efforts on supporting this new field.\\n\\nTraditional universities are particularly well-suited to making this digital-age flavor of training happen. Their buildings can be meeting places for public officials, supervisors, and students to work together on crucial policy problems. The University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon University are ahead of the game, already intentionally pulling together resources and faculty and offering new programs at the nexus of ethical technology and policy, but many others are committed to promoting similar collaborative work across departments.\\n\\nMIT and Georgetown Law School, for example, run a joint experiential course that brings law students and MIT technologists together to work on privacy-related problems; Princeton\\'s Center for Information Technology Policy takes students to Washington, DC, for a three-day Tech Policy Boot Camp. Much is happening; much more could be done, and far more systematically.\\n\\nThis is a powerful field-development trick: Attendees had to write down answers to questions like \"How will you develop new resources and mobilize existing funding mechanisms to expand the field?\" If the writer didn\\'t want to commit, they could say, \"We [the group of attendees] should\" do X or Y. And a final option was \"someone should\" do tasks that seemed beyond the remit of the group in the room.\\n\\nThe written commitments that emerged from the presidents and provosts were striking: \"I will raise this topic with at least two funders before the end of the year.\" \"I will integrate public interest technology into our programs in entrepreneurship and innovation.\" \"We should support public interest project-based learning for undergraduates.\" \"We should create a set of materials for career counseling that highlight jobs in public interest technology.\" \"We should create a fellowship program at the scale of the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships.\" And loan forgiveness, a crucial driver for the success of this new field, was a topic for every attendee.\\n\\nYes, this was just a meeting. But many great movements start with small gatherings, single images, and a great deal of patience. University presidents and provosts know that faculty need to cede some of their That\\'s Not My Field sovereignty in order to serve real student and community needs. The pioneering professors at the conference, my colleagues from across the country, are already doing cross-tech/policy work because they know it\\'s needed. Students are clamoring for just this kind of training and just these kinds of opportunities; the public sector, for its part, needs them to hurry up and graduate. The hope coming from that former horse-ring in Long Island last month is that the time has come for Public Interest Technology to be a \"thing\" nationwide.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"The first thing that hits you, the signal that this drab Michigan office building is a bit cooler than the average, is the smell. The acrid, metallic, plasticky, burning smell, the sort of odor that prompts the question: Is something that is really not supposed to be on fire on fire in here?\\n\\nNo, no, says Dave Bolognino, who heads up General Motors’ design fabrication division. That’s just the byproduct of 3-D printing. In a changing auto industry, this is what innovation (“rapid iteration” in business speak) smells like. And that smell might be wafting to other parts of the company.\\n\\nAbout 30,000 prototype parts get printed each year here at the Warren Tech Center, the sprawling, suburban home to many of the carmaker’s research and development efforts, which hosts over 20,000 GM employees. These parts are fabricated out of at least nine sorts of materials—combinations of plastics and metal and powders—and are used, mostly, for rapid prototyping, for those who want to quickly visualize or understand what a new sort of auto part or configuration would look like. That’s nothing new: GM has been 3D printing prototypes for three decades, starting under the eye of Bolognino’s father John, now retired in his late 70s.\\n\\nToday, specially trained workers run the printing machines six days a week, three shifts a day, a constant churn of popping parts out of molds and watching conglomerates emerge from powders and liquid resins. There’s no real limit to what employees can dream up and print out, says Bolognino, standing in front of a series of shelves filled with grayish mini-bumpers, wheels, and unidentifiable plastic squares cooling just off the printing machines. Though there is a limit on what they will print. A design team once asked for plastic Coke bottle, to use in a model cup holder. “Here’s a dollar fifty,” Bolognino told them. “Go buy one.”\\n\\n3-D printing, aka additive manufacturing, ain’t new at all, but you’ll see it now in more consumer products than ever before. Folks making shoes, dental implants, hearing aids, and even jet engine use printed parts. The Obama administration helped launch the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute back in 2012, a $70 million consortium of businesses and universities dedicated to coming up with new ways to use additive manufacturing to boost American business. The process allows these industries to craft oddly-shaped parts more quickly and with more flexibility than they did in the past.\\n\\nAnd outside GM’s malodorous workshop, 3-D printing is poised to become an even more vital part of the automotive manufacturing process. Carmakers like the Detroit giant are thinking about ways they can fold the process into actual production vehicles, the kind real people drive around every day.\\n\\n“The auto industry has been leading in the use of additive manufacturing for 30 years in the prototyping space,” says Mark Cotteleer, who heads up the consulting firm Deloitte’s Center for Integrated Research and has studied additive manufacturing for last five years. “We’re seeing them start to move into part production in limited ways, primarily at lower volumes.”\\n\\nIn May, GM unveiled its a bid to shoehorn more printing into carmaking. The result is—wait for it—a stainless steel seat bracket. A very, very weird looking seat bracket. Not that any car owners will ever see it.\\n\\nGenerally, building this sort of bracket, which provides a steely, firm base for a car’s seats and seat belt buckles, requires about eight separate parts, purchased from several different automotive suppliers. This new, bizarre one is one continuous component, with each curving tendril serving a specific stabilizing purpose. As a result, it’s 40 percent lighter and 20 percent stronger than the standard, GM says. For automakers who like to entice consumers with promises of faster vehicles with higher gas mileage, this kind of incremental lightweighting is a path to market domination.\\n\\nA worker completes a 3-D printed prototype at General Motors' Warren Tech Center, the automakers' Detroit-area research and development campus. General Motors\\n\\nGM created the seat bracket as a demo project in partnership with Autodesk, the San Francisco design and engineering software firm, which has an engineer constantly embedded with the carmaker’s design team in Michigan. Autodesk’s tech helps the GM designers input parameters—materials, need-to-have elements like holes for screws, cost, object stiffness, mass—to come up with inventive new ways to put parts together. The result is something Salvador Dalí might have dreamed up. Print it off in steel, et voila: a new approach to keeping everybody buckled in.\\n\\nNow, these sorts of seat brackets won’t make it into production cars just yet. The cost of additive manufacturing has come way down in the past few decades, but it’s not yet cheap enough for mass manufacturing. Printing is still too slow for a company that makes more than 8,000 vehicles a day. And integrating the process into the production line is no easy thing. “It’s not about just buying a 3-D printer, says Cotteleer. “For industrial-scale printing, there needs to be a whole digital backbone to send files to where they need to be. And what’s that model going to be?”\\n\\nStil, GM sees great promise in things like wacky seat brackets. “There are 30,000 parts and pieces on each of our vehicles,” says Kevin Quinn, the automaker’s director of additive design and manufacturing. “A realistic change is maybe 100 or 1,000 pieces have a chance to be printed. Five years from now, could that number raise to 5,000? Ten years from now, to 10,000?” The result might be a prettier, more material-efficient, lighter, faster car.\\n\\nIn the meantime, GM says it will also use additive manufacturing to create unique tools used during automotive production, or to customize slick decorative elements for one-off buyers. (Monogrammed grilles, anyone?)\\n\\nOf course, don’t expect entire cars to be printed anytime soon. “This is not a panacea,” says Cotteleer, explaining that a completely 3-D printed car would make no financial sense. But it’s nothing for carmakers to turn their nose up at, either.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'This week, a couple of hundred venture capitalists descended on the Computer History Museum, in Mountain View, California, for Y Combinator\\'s twice-annual Demo Day. The event showcases graduates of the famous incubator\\'s training program to investors who hope to sniff out the next Dropbox, Airbnb, or Stripe, all of which emerged from Y Combinator. But increasingly, the entrepreneurs marching onto the stage are as likely to be experts at manipulating molecules as writing lines of code.\\n\\nFor the first time, one-quarter of the 142 companies that presented in Y Combinator\\'s summer batch belong in the incubator\\'s \"bio\" category, which includes food and agricultural technology as well as all things healthcare. Since 2011, when it made its first bio investments, Y Combinator has steadily increased the number of such companies in its portfolio. The reasons reflect both the popularity of biotech among today\\'s entrepreneurs and the incubator\\'s growing name recognition in health and biology circles, says partner Dalton Caldwell.\\n\\nIn part, new bio companies are capitalizing on past achievements. “We now have enough companies in the ecosystem to build on top of each other,” Caldwell says. A bioreactor startup that Y Combinator incubated last winter helped two current attendees with their manufacturing. The success of another past graduate, Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks, has raised the incubator’s profile on the East Coast, attracting new applicants.\\n\\nOne company that highlights Y Combinator\\'s growing profile in the Boston-centric biotech sector is 64-x, which launched out of the lab of George Church, the famed Harvard genomicist. It engineers organisms with an entirely new genetic code, for example using amino acids not found in nature. These organisms\\' uniqueness makes them immune to \"every virus on Earth,\" explains cofounder Alexis Rovner. The company\\'s strains promise to help pharmaceutical firms produce drugs more efficiently, among other applications.\\n\\nOther companies focus on building devices to help monitor health at home. A startup called Togg, for example, is building radar sensors for use in nursing homes. In pilot tests, it has installed these slim devices, similar in appearance to a smoke detector, on the ceiling of seniors\\' rooms to monitor their breathing rate, activity levels, and other factors correlated with health. According to George Khasin, a cofounder, the company uses $150 sensors that five years ago cost more than $11,000, a drop driven by the broad usage of radar in new cars.\\n\\nThen there\\'s Higia, a company that offers a $299 bra with thermal sensors that screens its wearers for signs of breast cancer. Its founder, Julian Cantu, is still in his late teens, but he reports that the company sold 5,000 units in pre-orders in three weeks in Mexico. Cantu chose to launch Higia’s bra in Mexico as a regulatory \"hack,\" he says, to collect customers and data while the company navigates the more arduous US Food and Drug Administration approval process. In 2017, the FDA released a note warning consumers that it does not consider this type of screening, called thermography, an adequate replacement for a mammogram.\\n\\nA third device company, Qurasense, is undergoing the clinical trials needed to gain FDA approval, a hurdle not faced by more traditional software companies. Qurasense makes menstrual pads with a built-in blood collection strip that it plans to sell for $25 a month. Pull out the strip, drop it in the mail, and the company says it will share the test results—for HIV status, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and more—in its app. In the wake of Theranos\\'s high-profile collapse, this startup may face greater scrutiny from investors and regulators alike.\\n\\nAcknowledging the unique challenges of startups like Qurasense and Higia, Y Combinator recently brought on Diego Rey, a successful biotech entrepreneur, as a visiting partner. It also urges companies in the incubator to tap a past graduate, a startup called Enzyme, that provides \"FDA compliance as-a-service.\" The incubator\\'s staff is advising its companies to address their regulatory strategy in the roughly two-minute pitches they make on stage, Caldwell says.\\n\\nCompanies in the food sector can also face longer paths to market than pure software companies. Cambridge Glycoscience, for example, is pitching an affordable sugar substitute for use in cooking. \"The drinks industry can make Coke Zero, but the food industry can\\'t yet make Cake Zero,\" cofounder Tom Simmons announced onstage. \"But we did!\" They presented data from taste tests in which participants could not differentiate between their muffins and ones baked with traditional sugar. At the event, their pastry samples were just ok, but it was hard to tell if that was the fault of the sugar substitute, or because the founders\\' baking skills did not yet match their scientific chops.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'If your workspace has seemed a bit shoutier than usual in the last few days, you might have Nicole He to blame. The Brooklyn-based programmer and technologist is the creator of ENHANCE.COMPUTER, an online “cyberpunk game” that recalls the futuristic voice-command sleuth-machines found in films like Blade Runner: By shouting out directives like “MOVE DOWN!,” “MOVE LEFT!,” and especially “ENHANCE!,” you can zoom in on a picture, find a hidden code, and win...well, not much, save for the satisfaction of completely baffling the person sitting next to you. “It’s a game that makes people perform—and people are playing in their offices, in front of their coworkers,” says He, 29. And it’s a totally different game if other people are watching you do it, because, ideally, you have to yell.”\\n\\nA freelance creative technologist at Google Creative Lab, He spent about three weeks putting together ENHANCE.COMPUTER, which was made in collaboration with designer Barron Webster. The set-up is relatively simple: A tiny code is hidden in one of about 50 randomly generated photos; you have one minute to locate the code, which requires you to bark orders to your laptop at an increasingly frantic clip. It’s a tongue-in-cheek realization of two technologies that have been promised to TV and movie viewers for years: Artificial-intelligence systems that understand all of our spoken directives, and the impossibly blur-free zoom-ins that have fueled detective shows like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He’s game was intended as an affectionate look at “the reality of this technology as it exists now, as opposed to the techno-utopian ideal,” she says from Melbourne, where ENHANCE.COMPUTER was part of a recent experimental-game exhibition. “I also thought it would be really funny.”\\n\\nMuch of He’s previous work finds her approaching technology with a mix of affectionate skepticism and humor: True Love Tinder Robot, which gauges users’ hand-sweat levels to determine whether to swipe left or right; and Soylent Dick features a faux-phallus (made out of the faux-meal) that ...let’s just say responds whenever users type in a bit of soylent praise. “I’m interested in the ideas like, ‘What is this technology actually doing for us?’ ‘How is it broken?,” she says. “They’re critiques of technology. But at the same time, I’m an optimist who’s loving technology.”\\n\\nHe grew up in Cupertino, California, where the local tech-culture proved to be a huge influence in her decision not to go into tech. “It seemed really boring, like you were just in front of a computer each day,” she says. Instead, she moved to New York City to study journalism, which led to a community-management job at Kickstarter. “I got to meet a lot of creative people doing projects. That’s where I had this feeling of, ‘I want to make some stuff. I just don’t know what it is.’”\\n\\nEventually, she wound up at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, where she worked on projects like Unfamiliar Cat Petting Simulator. And now, He hopes ENHANCE.COMPUTER will remind users that voice-recognition technology is no longer a mere sci-fi trope, and that its applications go beyond Alexa or Siri. “I want people to use it for more stuff,” she says. “These platforms are being used for customer-service chatbot things, but people haven’t done too many really creative things with it.” For now, we’ll have to make do with games like ENHANCE.COMPUTER, which recently received a de facto endorsement from cyberpunk sire William Gibson, who retweeted He’s announcement. That’s one way to make sure awareness of your creation is...ENHANCED.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"As far as plant names go, the sleepy plant—or shy plant, or shameplant, known more formally as Mimosa pudica—is hard to beat. Touch one of its leaves and it curls up like it’s embarrassed, the leaflets folding in on each other. It’s hypnotic and, well, kind of a surprising response for an organism without a brain.\\n\\nNow, the shameplant is getting its very own robotic doppelganger. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed deceptively simple actuators (the fancy term for a motor that moves a robot) made of conductive 3-D printed material and paper. Apply electricity to the inked material and it shapeshifts, producing smooth movements. It’s not the burliest actuator by any means, but paper actuators could well carve out their own niche in robotics.\\n\\nVideo by Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\nThe trick is something called a polylactide, a kind of thermoplastic that provides shape memory. This is combined with graphene, which carries current, to make 3-D printed “ink.” After the printer lays down the ink on a piece of paper, the researchers pop it in an oven at 160 degrees Fahrenheit. When they pull it out, they bend it to the default shape they want the material to “remember” when the paper is at rest.\\n\\nTake a look at the GIF below of a paper gripper. When the researchers apply electricity, it produces heat, which activates the thermoplastic and softens it. With the thermoplastic now more malleable, the natural stiffness of the paper flattens everything out. So the fingers straighten a bit when current is applied, then return to a more curved default shape when the thermoplastic cools and hardens, thereby gripping the object. Without a heat source, it goes back to the default. “It basically becomes stiffer and pulls the paper substrate up again due to its shape memory effect,” says robot designer Lining Yao, who helped develop the system.\\n\\nVideo by Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\nThe researchers could also modify the system to respond to human touch. A finger will change the capacitance of the circuit, which a microcontroller detects. With a touch-sensitive actuator like this, the mechaplant can fold in on itself if disturbed, just like the real thing out in nature. The team also built a lamp that turns on with touch and changes shape as its vertical paper supports morph.\\n\\nThe return to the default shape, though, doesn’t happen particularly quickly. Once the electrical heat source is removed, the thermoplastic has to air-cool to stiffen up and assume the set shape. So maybe down the line, instead of a 3-D printed “ink” of thermoplastic, it could be more porous. “You can imagine if it's porous, the air can get in and out much faster,” says Yao.\\n\\nVideo by Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\nAnother downside, of course, is that paper isn’t the strongest of materials. It also has a pesky habit of catching on fire, which probably means paper actuators won’t have much of a role in, say, manufacturing robots.\\n\\nBut for kid or pet-friendly robots? Just maybe. So-called “soft” robots like this new paper system may be weaker, but they’re much better at getting along with humans. And they’re super cheap—helpful in any situation that prioritizes disposability.\\n\\nA bigger issue is the very nature of heat. “It is a really simple method—joule heating leads to thermal expansion—and uses inexpensive controls and materials, but it is incredibly inefficient,” says mechanical engineer Nicholas Kellaris, who studies actuators but who wasn’t involved in this paper. The electricity you start with is high grade energy, but heat? Not so much.\\n\\n“Since these paper actuators presented in the paper are not strong, I think their promise lies in art and interactive design with morphing structures,” says Kellaris. Like making mechaplants that are ashamed of themselves, for instance. If that’s not a promising future, I don’t know what is.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " \"Scientists in the US may be out in front developing the next generation of Crispr-based genetic tools, but it’s China that’s pushing those techniques toward human therapies the fastest. Chinese researchers were the first to Crispr monkeys, and non-viable embryos, and to stick Crispr’d cells into a real live human. And now, a team of scientists in China have used a cutting-edge Crispr technique, known as base editing, to repair a disease-causing mutation in viable human embryos.\\n\\nPublished last week in the journal Molecular Therapy, and reported first by Stat, the study represents significant progress over previous attempts to remodel the DNA of human embryos. That’s in part because the editing worked so well, and in part because that editing took place in embryos created by a standard in-vitro fertilization technique.\\n\\nSo-called “germline editing,” the contentious technology that can permanently change the code in every cell in the human body, has been gaining acceptance in the last few years as research has pushed forward, illuminating the possibilities of Crispr. Immediately following those first reports of embryonic gene-editing in China in 2015, an international summit convened by the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that actually trying to produce a human pregnancy from such modified germlines was “irresponsible,” given ongoing safety concerns and lack of societal consensus. Two years later, a report from the NAS and the National Academy of Medicine stated that clinical trials for editing out heritable diseases could be permitted in the future, but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.\\n\\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Crispr\\n\\nAttitudes may be slowly changing: Last month, the United Kingdom’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics went so far as to say that heritable genome editing could be “ethically acceptable in some circumstances.” A Pew Research Council study released at the end of July found that 72 percent of Americans think changing an unborn baby’s DNA to treat a serious disease would be an appropriate use of gene-editing technology.\\n\\nIn the study published in Molecular Therapy, the Chinese scientists corrected a mutation that causes Marfan syndrome, an incurable connective tissue disorder that affects about 1 in 5,000 people. A single letter mistake in the gene for FBN1, which codes for the fibrillin protein, can cause a ripple effect of problems—from loose joints to weak vision to life-threatening tears in the heart’s walls. Starting with healthy eggs and sperm donated by a Marfan syndrome patient, the team of researchers from Shanghai Tech University and Guangzhou Medical University used an IVF technique to make viable human embryos. Then they injected the embryos with a Crispr construct known as a base editor, which swaps out a single DNA nucleotide for another—in this case, removing an “A” and replacing it with a “G”. They kept the embryos alive for another two days in the lab, long enough to run tests to see how well the editing worked.\\n\\nSequencing revealed that all 18 embryos had been edited, with 16 of the embryos bearing only the corrected version of the FBN1 gene. In two of the embryos, additional unwanted edits had also taken place. Previously, the most successful demonstration of gene editing in the human germline was the correction of a mutation that causes a hereditary heart condition in 42 out of 58 embryos. That study, which was published last year, used standard Crispr cut-and-paste technology.\\n\\n“It’s a nice demonstration of the use of base editors to correct a well-known point mutation that causes a human genetic disease in a setting that may become therapeutically relevant,” says David Liu, whose lab at Harvard developed the base editor used to correct the Marfan mutation, though he was not involved in the study.\\n\\nRather than breaking the double-stranded DNA molecule and allowing the cell to repair itself with a healthy gene template, these newer versions of Crispr change just a single letter. If Crispr is a pair of molecular scissors, Liu’s base editors are more like a pencil with a squeaky new eraser. While the hope is that such precise gene-writing implements won’t cause the kind of sloppy chaos that Crispr 1.0 is capable of, Liu says it’s too early to make any general statements about their relative risks as a therapeutic. “Despite more than 50 publications using base editors from laboratories around the world, the entire field of base editing is only about two years old, and additional studies are needed to assess as many possible consequences of base editing as can be reasonably detected.”\\n\\nSome of those studies are being conducted at Beam Therapeutics, the startup that Liu co-founded earlier this year with fellow Crispr pioneer Feng Zhang. Beam’s first license agreement with Harvard covers Liu’s C base editor, which makes programmable C-to-T or G-to-A edits. The second is the A base editor, which can do T-to-C as well as A-to-G edits, like the one used to correct the Marfan mutation. But don’t expect Beam to be erasing genetic diseases from the germline any time soon. The company is focused on using base editing to treat serious diseases in children and adults only, not on embryo editing, says CEO John Evans. “More consideration would be needed before society is ready to consider embryo editing, and we look forward to participating in the discussion.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, Beam will be just one of many US companies looking at an increasingly streamlined path for genetic medicines. In July, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced a new regulatory framework for gene therapies to treat rare diseases. The agency issued a suite of six guidance documents updating the approval process. And on August 17, the FDA along with the National Institutes of Health proposed changes in the way the agencies together assess the safety of gene-therapy human trials.\\n\\nSpecifically, the proposals will eliminate review by the NIH’s Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which was established in 1974 to advise on emerging genetic technologies. In a New England Journal of Medicine editorial describing the changes, Gottlieb and NIH Director Francis Collins wrote it was their view that “there is no longer sufficient evidence to claim that the risks of gene therapy are entirely unique and unpredictable—or that the field still requires special oversight that falls outside our existing framework for ensuring safety.” A more streamlined approval process may help the US move faster in the long-run, though probably not enough to catch China’s head start. But when it comes to gene editing's most controversial applications, there’s nothing wrong with being slow.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'Early Tuesday, Microsoft announced that last week it seized control of six domains owned by the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also known as APT28. The hackers had used the sites to mount midterm election-related phishing campaigns, similar to those Fancy Bear launched during the 2016 United States election season. It\\'s the most prominent, publicly known effort to proactively identify and thwart Russian election hacking efforts—and Microsoft\\'s in a unique position to pull it off.\\n\\nThe newly announced takedowns were just the latest from Microsoft\\'s Digital Crimes Unit, which had previously disclosed that it blocked phishing attempts against three congressional campaigns. While Russia\\'s political hacking in the US has mostly appeared to target Democrats, Microsoft pointed out that this time many of the phishing sites—which impersonated think tanks and some Senate pages—targeted Republican groups that have criticized President Donald Trump\\'s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nWith the midterms just three months away, Microsoft aggressively detected and and disabled Fancy Bear phishing sites to deflate the group\\'s efforts. \"We have now used this approach 12 times in two years to shut down 84 fake websites associated with this group,\" wrote Microsoft president Brad Smith. \"Despite last week’s steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and other sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks across the political spectrum in the United States.\"\\n\\nSend It To the Sinkhole\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s ability to pull off these preemptive strikes stems less from technological innovation than from a lawsuit the company brought against Fancy Bear in 2016, first reported by The Daily Beast. Because Fancy Bear phishing efforts mimic and blend into Microsoft services, the court granted the company standing to take legal action, which not only allowed for its 2016 suit, but also laid the groundwork for Microsoft to seek court approvals as needed to take down malicious sites.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s not a gimmick, but it\\'s also not an innovation.\\' David Kennedy, Binary Defense Systems\\n\\nSpecifically, Microsoft has used a technique known as sinkholing, a way to divert network traffic from its planned destination to a different server. Microsoft combines its broad visibility into its billions of users, and the chops of its internal Digital Crimes Unit, to get a jump on phishing sites like the ones Fancy Bear established, get legal permission to take over those domains, and then send any traffic that heads their way to oblivion instead.\\n\\n\"It’s not a gimmick, but it’s also not an innovation,\" says David Kennedy, CEO of the threat tracking firm Binary Defense Systems, who formerly worked at the NSA and with the Marine Corps\\' signal intelligence unit. \"Sinkholes are used to seize malicious domains in order to protect. It\\'s a very common practice and used all around the security industry.\"\\n\\nIn this case, it\\'s an especially useful technique. The Fancy Bear sites Microsoft hunts down are designed to look like familiar, legitimate political portals for campaigns, lobbying groups, think tanks, and more. A phishing attack lures people who work for or with those organizations into entering the login credentials and other information they would normally use on the legitimate versions of those sites. When Microsoft observes this type of activity—through tracking Fancy Bear\\'s movements across the web, or flagging indicators like telltale patterns in user data—the company investigates, and begins considering a takedown.\\n\\nOnce it makes that call, Microsoft would have a range of options. The company hasn\\'t shared specifics, and did not respond to a request by press time, but many sinkholes route traffic by altering the Domain Name System registry—basically the internet\\'s phone book lookup—so the domain you want to sinkhole redirects to your own server instead. Microsoft could either take Fancy Bear sites down in one fell swoop, or gain domain control quietly, and conduct some reconnaissance before delivering the final blow.\\n\\nStanding Out\\n\\nOther tech companies like Level 3, now owned by CenturyLink, and Palo Alto Networks have used sinkholes to take down botnets, mostly related to digital crime syndicates. But many mainstream tech firms that would be well-positioned to do similar work, like Google, have been quieter about these types of initiatives. Google does send warnings to Gmail users when it sees evidence that state-sponsored hackers may be trying to phish certain accounts. The company said on Monday that it just sent a new batch of thousands of warnings, though not timed to any specific attack.\\n\\n\\'Microsoft has an entire specialized team whose job it has been to do this for many years.\\' Dave Aitel, Cyxtera\\n\\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has focused on takedowns for years. \"Microsoft Security has a history of working sinkhole operations,\" says Jake Williams, a former NSA analyst and the founder of Rendition Infosec. \"They do a ton of threat research.\" Collaborating with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, the company has used sinkholing to neuter botnets and more. As with Fancy Bear, the company has experimented before with laying legal groundwork first.\\n\\n\"Microsoft has an entire specialized team whose job it has been to do this for many years, working closely with US law enforcement,\" says Dave Aitel, a former NSA researcher who is now chief security technology officer at the secure infrastructure firm Cyxtera. \"The interesting thing in the recent reports has been the direct attribution to Russia. It may be that we are witnessing a norm being changed with regards to how far private companies will go against nation states.\"\\n\\nThreat intelligence firms typically shy away from saying with certainty that they know who perpetrated a particular digital attack, or what their motives are. It often takes months or years for attribution to emerge publicly. But Microsoft has been definitive so far in pinning the phishing sites on Fancy Bear.\\n\\n\"Microsoft coming out publicly and saying who it is—that\\'s not what we typically see from them,\" Binary Defense Systems\\'s Kennedy says. \"Attribution isn’t an easy thing, it requires a lot of time and investment in tracing the actors. But there’s a concerted effort across public and private groups in finding out what Russia is doing and outing them, because they are our most active adversary.\"\\n\\nThough sinkholing is a popular and reliable defense tool that can neuter malicious sites, it can\\'t stop adversaries from endlessly launching new ones and attempting to better conceal them. As a result, motivated and well-resourced attackers who are beyond law enforcement\\'s reach will forge ahead, evolving and innovating to continue their attacks in new ways. Microsoft\\'s takedown efforts alone can\\'t resolve the threat of Russian election meddling. But it can certainly slow hackers, down and potentially make their attacks less effective.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t have a lot of arrows in the quiver in terms of cyberpolicy, so Microsoft is filling a gap here,\" Cyxtera\\'s Aitel says. \"It would be great if we could deter this behavior in another way, but for now this is what we have.\"\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'Back in 2012, a Seattle-based startup named FiftyThree launched a drawing app designed exclusively for iPad, with a name that sounded like it was designed specifically for an Apple crowd: Paper. Despite its simplicity and also because of it, Apple crowned it the iPad App of the Year. Tech writers described it as “the next great iPad app”, “a superbly designed sketching app,” and “a fresh canvas ready and waiting for your ideas, inspiration, and art.” FiftyThree later expanded to include an iPhone app, an optional subscription called Paper Pro, and Paste, a collaboration app.\\n\\nFiftyThree also managed to do what few app startups have done: make and sell hardware. Its $60, soft-nibbed, walnut stylus, called Pencil, presaged Apple’s eventual entry into the world of stylii.\\n\\nToday FiftyThree announced its apps and team have been acquired by WeTransfer, a cloud-based file transfer company with headquarters in Amsterdam and Los Angeles. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but WeTransfer said it had acquired the company’s entire patent portfolio and all assets for its apps. FiftyThree’s executive team and product teams will stay on board for now. As for the future of FiftyThree’s suite of apps, including Paper, which has 25 million users, the company says the apps will live on with “increased investment and support.”\\n\\nWIRED spoke to FiftyThree cofounder and CEO Georg Petschnigg about why he sold FiftyThree, the biggest changes he’s observed in the app economy over the past several years, and why he and his team ignored the words of Steve Jobs and made a stylus anyway. The interview has been condensed for length.\\n\\nWIRED: Talk about why you sold FiftyThree. How long have you been in acquisition talks for?\\n\\nGeorg Petschnigg: We’d been in each other’s orbits for a long time, because Troy Carter and Suzy Ryoo are shared investors and advisors. But then the conversations started in earnest a few months after we launched Paste, our team collaboration product [in November 2017].\\n\\nI went on a very, very long walk with Gordon [Willoughby], their CEO, in New York. We walked from first the East Side to West Side, and then the West Side all the way over DUMBO. We crossed Manhattan several times. Then a few days later, I met with cofounding shareholder Damian [Bradfield] in London. And it was very clear that this was meant to happen.\\n\\nThey have this unique business model where they’re able to offer a free, ad-supported version and a subscription version, and what’s unique about their free version is they do this by respecting people’s privacy and their data. And at the same time we were looking at expanding our Paste app on the desktop, and that’s where WeTransfer has a very strong business and a much more active user base.\\n\\nWIRED: Had you been talking to any other companies about acquisition?\\n\\nGP: Over the last seven years? Oh, jeez. (Laughs.) There have been various talks in different forms and different phases. But the thing that has always given us the most joy is figuring out how to put technology in service for creativity, and it turns out there are a lot of people who say they provide those services, and a lot of people who truly believe in it and do it every day. We felt that was the case here.\\n\\nWIRED: Let’s go back to the beginning when you first started FiftyThree. What was your goal then, and how did that reflect what apps and the App Store were like at that point in time time?\\n\\nGP: When you look at the founding team at FiftyThree, we came from two very different parts of Microsoft. One hand was working on productivity tools—Word, Powerpoint, Excel—essentially making people more efficient, squeezing more performance out of the brain. And the other hand you had folks from Xbox and a lot of entertainment products, ensuring that people went back to their leisure time. And somehow, you’re sort of wasting people’s time on one hand, and on the other hand you’re making them a better, faster cog in the machine. Something about the human experience was lost between those two.\\n\\n\\'it wasn’t until Cambridge Analytica that I would say consumers really started becoming more aware of what is happening when you use free software.\\' Georg Petschnigg, FiftyThree\\n\\nAnd then when iPad launched, it wasn’t clear what iPad was going to be for. Maybe it was going to be the next-generation magazine, with publishers creating new magazine formats. Maybe it was going to be the next big video service. People really didn’t know. When we looked at it, we clearly saw the iPad for creativity. That lead to the Paper app, where you could take the ideas in your head and quickly translate them via your fingertips into ink strokes. It really changed people’s perception of the iPad, but for us, it also put FiftyThree on the map.\\n\\nThe next step for us then, which really started in 2012, was to think through the stylus as a tool. That ended up leading to the development of Pencil.\\n\\nWIRED: What strikes me is that it sounds like you’re saying that transition to hardware was a pretty natural thing. But at the same time hardware is really hard, especially in the startup world if you don’t have the supply chain or product management expertise. So what was it that made you say, let’s make hardware?\\n\\nGP: Yes, hardware is hard but when you look at our founding hardware team...I mean John Ikeda was part of the development team that created the original Xbox 360 controller; our head of engineering led engineering at Sonos; our product manager who was running the program ran the supply chain for Sonos as well. So in a way, yes, hardware is hard and I absolutely wouldn’t do that if you didn’t have a great network and team. But in our case, many people at FiftyThree had reached levels in their careers where they were comfortable with it. So it wasn’t, ‘Can we build the product?’ but instead, ‘Are we building the right product?’\\n\\nWIRED: How many Pencils did you sell? Was it profitable for FiftyThree?\\n\\nGP: Oh yeah. This was also the very unusual part: It was a profitable hardware program. I don’t think we ever disclosed how many we sold.\\n\\nWIRED: So what’s interesting is that your app Paper was, from the beginning, considered to be an Apple darling. And then Apple came out with something called...Pencil. What was that moment like for you and your team?\\n\\nGP: That was...We…(long pause)...Look, when we were out starting FiftyThree in 2011, I can’t tell you the number of people who told us that proverbial Steve Jobs story about styluses. People would just tell me over and over again, ‘A stylus is bad; don’t do it.’\\n\\nWhat our team really believed is that we had to develop new technology that allowed us to move creativity forward on devices. Today, when you look at the stylus landscape, it’s clear what a deep impact Pencil—in particular the design of Pencil—had. Stylii today are buttonless, they have a fine tip to write, they have a side to shade, they emphasize expressiveness and creation. The design language of that was created through Pencil. [Writer’s note: FiftyThree discontinued its hardware business at the end of 2016.]\\n\\nFiftyThree\\n\\nWIRED: Your software also evolved along with the App Store. At first your app was free; that was maybe part of the assumption then, during App 1.0, that things would be free. And then you started offering something more advanced as a subscription, which seems like it was hitting this curve of app makers trying to monetize what they were doing and not in spammy, gross ways. So talk a little bit about that evolution of software.\\n\\nGP: When we first launched Paper with in-app purchases, that was phenomenal. As someone coming from the world of shrink-wrapped software sales, very large software sales, the idea that you could sell an in-app purchase or productivity tool and only sell as much software as people needed was hugely appealing. That worked very well initially. The only challenge is that you quickly realize that the first version of your software is the cheapest to develop. Software, especially that’s used by millions of people, the support and ongoing maintenance is way more expensive than the initial development.\\n\\nWhat muddled the picture over the years, though, is actually the introduction of free software that is financed by the sale of data. And it wasn’t until Cambridge Analytica that I would say consumers really started becoming more aware of what is happening when you use free software. Like, something is truly being sold. You are being targeted. And that’s happening because people are selling interpretations or analyses on top of your data. And it’s not just Facebook. But that did lead to somewhat of a warped price perspective on how much software ought to cost.\\n\\nSo when Apple started that shift to software subscriptions, it was a really important and very big shift. But the consumer understanding of, ‘How many subscriptions should I have?’, or ‘Why should I buy a subscription?’ and ‘How does that work?’ I think that will take a few more years for it to really take hold.\\n\\nWIRED: Would you say that subscriptions have been successful for you?\\n\\nGP: Yes, they have been.\\n\\nWIRED: So one of the things I’m hearing you say is Paper is a profitable program, Pencil was profitable for you...is FiftyThree profitable at this point in time?\\n\\nGP: Well, FiftyThree as a company no longer exists, but, WeTransfer is a profitable company. FiftyThree was not profitable at the time of the acquisition.1\\n\\nWIRED: Why sell?\\n\\nGP: In our case it’s because we wanted to be part of a larger offering, and from a brand and culture perspective, and a business perspective, it was a great fit.\\n\\nWIRED: What would you say has been the biggest change you’ve seen in the app economy over the past seven years?\\n\\nGP: There have been so many things. One thing is, iPad Pro and the introduction of Apple Pencil has transformed that computing experience.\\n\\nThere’s also that channel fatigue and people not wanting to install new apps, and I think people are having a much more mature and healthy relationship, or at least, the beginnings of a much more healthy relationship with technology where we’re all realizing how much it can distract you. I don’t think it’s surprising that the most successful applications right now are meditation applications.\\n\\nAlso, our relationship with data is changing. The business economics around subscription models are still forming.\\n\\nAnother thing that’s changed is that people have become such great photographers. To me that’s kind of incredible. Where we are today, looking at the visual fluency people have, and how they’ve gotten there through technology, that’s been an incredible shift. So yeah, seven years of working through and around the App Store, it’s been quite the journey.\\n\\nWIRED: So the first thing you mentioned just now is iPad Pro and the introduction of Pencil. I’m just so curious as to how your team reacted to that. Did Apple call and say, ‘Hey, we’re making a Pencil!’ I mean really, what’s the story behind that?\\n\\nGP: What I can tell you right now is that it had a material effect on our business. But not a materially positive effect, let’s put it that way.\\n\\n1Correction: An earlier version of this article quoted Petschnigg as saying, \"We transferred as a profitable company.\" The correct statement is, \"WeTransfer is a profitable company.\"\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",

       " 'Sennheiser’s new HD 820 headphones solve the one imperfection of the German company’s coveted HD 800s. See, the previous model has an open-back design, which gooses the audio but lets ambient noise leak in—and all of Bowie’s histrionic sighs leak out. This year, Sennheiser put a lid on the 800s. Two lids, actually: The high-definition dynamic drivers in the HD 820s are covered with curved Gorilla Glass panels. The caps’ concave design reflects errant sound waves into a resonance-abating absorber to keep the audio crisp. The music retains the detail found in the open design, minus the pesky leakage. In an elegant touch, the clear glass leaves the intricate, shiny transducers visible, like the rear crystal on a mechanical Swiss watch. Über-phones like these require a dedicated amplifier; pair them with Sennheiser’s HDV 820 amp (another $2,400) to hear “Ashes to Ashes” like never before.\\n\\n$2,400\\n\\nBuy Now\\n\\nStyling by Reina Takahashi\\n\\nThis article appears in the August issue.

       " 'This year, Fitbit finally figured out how to make a smartwatch people really like, while sales of its lightweight activity trackers have been on the decline. But that’s not stopping the company from putting out new activity tracking wristbands. It just announced its newest device: the Fitbit Charge 3.\\n\\nAt first glance, the Charge 3 looks simply like a new take on an old tracker. It has the same wristband form factor, the same unremarkable display as previous Charges, which historically have been Fitbit\\'s most popular product. It even has the same price as the Charge 2 did when it launched: $149.95 for the standard model, and $169.95 for a “special edition” model that comes with Fitbit Pay and an extra black classic band. But the Charge 3\\'s build, guts, and software features have changed enough to warrant serious consideration if you’ve been thinking about updating your Fitbit.\\n\\nFitbit\\n\\nThe display on the Charge 3 is nearly 40 percent bigger than the display on the Charge 2. It\\'s the first in the Charge lineup to have a touchscreen. Sure, the black display still has an oddly-large bezel you can see if you peer closely enough at it, and Fitbit still feels compelled to have the word “Fitbit” written on the face of its products. But this is a Fitbit, not an Hermès watch.\\n\\nThe module is now made of space-grade aluminum instead of stainless steel and plastic. There’s an inverted, inductive button on the side rather than a mechanical button. Press your finger on it, and the Charge 3 will give haptic feedback. On the tracker’s underside, you’ll find an updated heart-rate sensing module—the same one that’s in the Fitbit Versa, which includes an SpO2 sensor to measure oxygen saturation. (Since this is a consumer device, it isn’t a substitute for medical equipment, but it can give an approximation.) The SpO2 sensor also plays a role in Fitbit’s grand plans for future health tracking.\\n\\nAs with previous Charge products, there’s no built-in GPS sensors for measuring distance while running and cycling. But this also boosts the battery life. For the Charge 3, that translates to a claim of up to seven days on a single charge. It also comes with yet another proprietary charger, which had to be redesigned to accommodate the Charge 3’s new heart rate module.\\n\\nThanks to its larger screen and upgraded processor, Fitbit has crammed smartwatch-like interactions into the Charge 3: You can swipe up to see your daily dashboard, swipe down to see notifications from smartphone, swipe left to go through workout options and apps, and so on.\\n\\nLike many Fitbits before it, the Charge 3 will track a whole bunch of health metrics and workout activities: steps, distance traveled, calories burned, stairs climbed, walking, running, cycling, yoga, elliptical, strength training. One new feature: It’s water-resistant up to 50 meters, so there’s a new swim mode on the device. It also auto-pauses if you stop at a stoplight (or stop because you’re winded, like I do) during a run.\\n\\nFitbit says it has improved its heart rate algorithms “in the order of 10 to 20 percent in running and cycling conditions,” according to Conor Heneghan, the company’s lead research scientist.1 (In the past, consumers have filed suit against Fitbit for what they claimed was inaccurate heart rate tracking by a significant margin.) And now Fitbit is attempting to correlate more insights for people; it might tell wearers, for example, that their heart rate data suggested they were particularly stressed one week, and so they might want to try Fitbit’s “Relax” app.\\n\\nFinally, Fitbit is launching a beta version of something it\\'s calling \"Sleep Score.\" It\\'s a score that will be assigned to wearers each day as an overall assessment of their sleep quality, but will also include information on sleep disruptions, the company says. This isn\\'t limited to Charge 3; it will roll out to any Fitbit with newer heart rate sensors.\\n\\nThis is a Fitbit, not an Hermès watch.\\n\\nFitbit is loading on the features at a time when competition is only getting stiffer in wearable land. And by pre-announcing a wearable that isn’t shipping until October, Fitbit seems anxious to get the Charge 3 out there ahead of whatever wearable Apple might show off next month. Samsung also just announced a new flagship smartwatch, the $350 Galaxy Watch.\\n\\nDespite Fitbit’s brand recognition, its concerns about Apple Watch are well-founded, since the company ceded the top spot to Apple last year in wearables. For a corporations like Apple or Xiaomi, wearable devices are just a part of their overall strategy; for Fitbit, it’s the entire business. Fitbit co-founder and chief executive James Park insists there’s still room for growth in both lightweight activity trackers and smartwatches, and that if you were to look at a Venn diagram of the two types of consumers, there’s some overlap there (people who might consider both). He may be right. But right now, Fitbit isn’t selling enough in either category to beat out its competitors.\\n\\nFitbit’s efforts around more advanced health-tracking have been slow going too, although those are potentially some of the more interesting features that the company’s R&D team is working on. Last year it said was coming up with a solution for tracking sleep apnea through its more advanced wrist wearables—including the new Charge 3, which has the newer heart rate sensors. It also said it was working with glucose monitor maker Dexcom to develop an app that could help people with diabetes keep track of their glucose.\\n\\n“When you look at the killer app for these devices, it’s health,” says Park. “And people’s interest in their health and well-being is only going to increase over time. So I think we have to deliver devices, and more importantly, algorithms and software, that make it relevant for people.”\\n\\nThe Dexcom app and sleep apnea tracking product haven’t launched yet, though, and Fitbit would need FDA approval before it attached any kind of official medical claims to its devices. Park said that the company is working separately with the FDA on a regulated product for advanced sleep tracking, but didn’t have a timeline yet for when that would launch. “We see things like this as check engine light or a seat belt for your health,” Park said. “Something that, one day, you wouldn’t want to leave your house without. And I think the addressable market for these types of devices is huge.”\\n\\nThat’s a big “if” for Fitbit. But if it gets there, it sure would be a huge leap—or many steps—beyond basic activity trackers.\\n\\n1Correction: An earlier version of this article attributed a quote to Dennis Hsu, Fitbit\\'s director of product marketing. The story has been updated to say that it was Conor Heneghan, Fitbit\\'s lead research scientist, who made the statement about heart rate tracking improvements.',\n",
       " 'If you were watching MTV in 1990, you might remember seeing Madonna, draped in an American flag, bopping around between snapping backup dancers, and encouraging viewers to vote in that year\\'s midterm elections. It was the first-ever ad for Rock the Vote, the youth-focused voter engagement group that has partnered with MTV in splashy, celeb-studded campaigns ever since.\\n\\nFast forward nearly three decades, and MTV is still striving to turn out the next generation of voters. Now, however, the network is hoping to deploy an even mightier tool than Madonna in the 90s: FOMO in 2018.\\n\\nAt the Video Music Awards Monday, MTV will premiere +1TheVote, a new digital initiative aimed at getting young people to convince their friends to register to vote with them. The site allows users to search their friends by name or upload their entire contact lists to see who is and isn\\'t already registered. Then, it prompts them to reach out to those friends on Facebook Messenger, Twitter, or email with made-for-meme messages like, \"When you find out your friend isn’t registered to vote, but they’re at every march... ☕\" and \"👏We 👏 should 👏 vote 👏 together 👏 - it takes 2 minutes to register. Do it right now: plus1thevote.com.\"\\n\\nThe goal, according to MTV president Chris McCarthy, is to capitalize on this generation\\'s instinct to share every facet of their lives. \"They\\'re the most connected generation ever,\" McCarthy says. \"Why not launch something that really harnesses the most powerful forces in their lives?\"\\n\\nIronically, it\\'s those same forces—the generational shift toward social platforms—that weakened MTV\\'s standing as the primary cultural hub for American youth over the last decade. As YouTube stars and Instagram influencers became pop culture\\'s new tastemakers, it appeared for a while that the more than 30-year-old network had outgrown the audience it once commanded. Then, in 2016, McCarthy took the helm and gave MTV a much-needed makeover, reviving beloved unscripted series like Jersey Shore and doubling down on programming designed for social media. Now, the network is on track for its fifth-straight quarter of ratings growth among 18- to 34-year-olds.\\n\\n\\'They\\'re the most connected generation ever. Why not launch something that really harnesses the most powerful forces in their lives?\\' Chris McCarthy, MTV\\n\\nFor McCarthy, the midterms are coming at just the right time. \"It feels right to do this is in a time when we’re in a resurgence,\" he says of the voter registration initiative. MTV\\'s changing fortunes also happened to overlap with what McCarthy calls an \"awakening\" in political activism among young people, catalyzed by the shooting in Parkland, Florida earlier this year, which drove students into the streets in record numbers during the March For Our Lives. In June of this year, MTV\\'s own polling found that 46 percent of 15- to 34-year-olds said they believe they can make a difference in government, up from just 37 percent in March.\\n\\n\"They see themselves in the marches and in the walkouts,\" McCarthy says. \"They\\'re really seeing an impact.\"\\n\\nAnd yet, young people remain a frustratingly difficult voting block to move, particularly during midterm elections. According to the Census Bureau, in 2014, just 23 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds voted. \"There’s an incredibly low turnout in midterm elections. That point cannot be overemphasized,\" says Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of a group at Tufts University called CIRCLE, which researches youth voting habits and is partnering with MTV on +1TheVote. CIRCLE\\'s research also suggests that young voters have even less trust in political institutions than older voters.\\n\\nBut what does motivate young voters, according to CIRCLE’s research, is peer pressure. “It’s really friends they trust the most, and there are very few other things they trust,” Kawashima-Ginsberg says. “The power of the peer combined with accountability and pressure is important.”\\n\\nThat motivator isn’t just limited to young people. One 2012 Yale University study found a higher turnout among voters who received mailers promising to share their turnout history with their households and their neighbors. Facebook, meanwhile, participated in a massive study during the 2010 midterms involving 61 million users. Some were shown a message reminding them to vote, while others got the same message, only with photos of their friends who had clicked the “I Voted” button attached. That study, published in 2012, found that voters who got the message with their friends’ photos were .4 percent more likely to vote compared to the other group and a control group, who received no message at all. That may sound like a negligible boost, but the researchers said it was significant, translating to an estimated 340,000 additional votes.\\n\\nIn 2012, President Obama\\'s campaign invested heavily in this sort of outreach, building a tool that strategically told Obama supporters which of their Facebook friends they should, for instance, encourage to vote.\\n\\nThis body of research convinced MTV to maximize social pressure heading into the midterms. In addition to the online tool, MTV will be sponsoring parties at polling stations with the group #VoteTogether in November. The Ford Foundation, The Alliance for Youth Organizing, and a startup called TurboVote are also partners. (Rock the Vote is not.)\\n\\n+1TheVote is still a work in progress. For starters, MTV\\'s tool can\\'t scrape a user\\'s social media profile to search for friends who aren\\'t registered, unlike the Obama campaign\\'s tool. Facebook cut off that capability for new apps in 2014 to protect user data. That means +1TheVote users need to either manually enter their friends\\' names and cities, or upload contact lists from their email providers. On top of that, the tool does not yet have an integration with Gmail, the most popular email client, though MTV says it is currently working on one.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether MTV still has enough cache to move young voters—or whether anyone can. But if +1TheVote does succeed in registering young voters and increasing their turnout, it\\'s likely the Democrats will benefit more than Republicans. While +1TheVote is non-partisan, younger voters have traditionally leaned left. So does MTV\\'s programming. During last year\\'s VMA\\'s, host Katy Perry introduced the best new artist category calling it the “election where the popular vote actually matters.” In March, the network went dark to support the national school walkouts protesting gun violence. Even dating shows like Are You the One? have revealed partisan inclinations recently. During this season\\'s premiere, one cast member\\'s support for President Trump earns him boos from the rest of his house mates and poses a threat to a blossoming romance.\\n\\nMcCarthy says all this is merely a reflection of its audience, a younger generation that is increasingly multicultural and passionate about issues of equality. \"When it comes to gender equality, when it comes to racial equality, LGBT equality, those are table stakes for this generation. That\\'s the way they believe the world should be,\" he says. \"We agree with them.\"\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"In 2015, German-born photographer Katrin Korfmann was living in China; her husband, sculptor Jens Pfeifer, was doing a three-month artist’s residency there. One day, Pfeifer gave Korfmann a tour of the factory that was fabricating some of his sculptures. As soon as they saw the crowded factory floor and its dozens of artisans performing their various alchemical tasks, the couple1 knew they had the subject for her next series.\\n\\n“In Western society, we often have this idea of the solitary artist in his or her studio, getting inspiration,” Korfmann explains. “It’s a very Romantic ideal of the artist. But there’s also a lot of hard work involved, often physical work. Sometimes the artist has an idea, and then the work gets produced in a factory that has nothing to do with the idea.” Rather than focus on the finished work of art, she and Pfeifer decided to highlight everything that happens behind the scenes to make that art possible.\\n\\nThus began three years of travel that took them around the world: a marble production company in Carrara, Italy; a ballet rehearsal in Amsterdam; an 11th-century tannery in Morocco; a glass factory Anxi, China. At each location, they mounted a camera on a 20-foot-high tripod and, over the course of several hours, took hundreds of photos of the workspace—a process Korfmann likens to “scanning” the location with her camera.\\n\\nBack in the studio, Korfmann and Pfeifer then digitally stitched together the photos to create a single, bird’s-eye view of the various fabrication processes, a technique that took her and her assistants anywhere from a week to a month. Rather than capturing an exact facsimile of the space, the process allowed the photographer to combine all the various facets of artistic production—time-lapse photography collapsed into a single image.\\n\\n“What you see in the final image isn’t a documentary truth,” Korfmann says. “It’s more of an interpretation of the spot. It’s an assemblage of hundreds of images.” (An exhibition of the images, which Korfmann produced with Pfeifer, will open at Los Angeles’s Kopeikin Gallery on November 11.)\\n\\nAn alternative way to capture such a wide array of action in a single shot would have been to use a fish-eye lens, Korfmann says, but that would have distorted the edges of the image. Only by painstakingly assembling dozens of discrete high-resolution images could she create a final image with such remarkable clarity. Many of the photographs show dozens of people, each of whom Korfmann shot individually and then combined into a single master shot. But Korfmann rejects the idea that using such digital legerdemain is somehow “cheating.”\\n\\n“Even if you take one picture, you choose the moment of reality,” she points out. “From the moment you exclude something from reality, you’re giving an interpretation. What I do is really just an extension of that.”\\n\\n1 Correction appended, 8/21/2018, 2:02 pm EDT: This story was changed to make clear that Korfmann and Pfeifer collaborated on the project equally, rather than Korfmann producing with Pfeifer's assistance.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",

       " 'NASA’s Cassini spacecraft lived for an astounding 20 years, making it one of the longest running missions of all time. The spacecraft, which launched in 1997 and died by diving into Saturn’s atmosphere last year, spent more than a decade doting over the ringed planet. In this, one of the most spectacular photos ever taken by Cassini, you can see the planet peeking through the gaps in its glorious rings. Cassini got the shot in April 2007, from 450,000 miles above Saturn’s surface.\\n\\nEver wondered what a partial solar eclipse looks like—from space? Last week on August 11, while only parts of Asia, North America, and Northern Europe could see the moon slide between Earth and the Sun, the partial solar eclipse was quite the show for the European Space Agency’s Proba-2 satellite. These images, showing the beginning and end of the eclipse, were taken about two hours apart.\\n\\nIt’s easy to forget about the International Space Station, orbiting above our heads at 17,000 miles per hour and going all the way around Earth every 90 minutes. The station isn’t just a football-sized science laboratory, but a way to help the world’s countries achieve their #SpaceGoals. Here we see three small satellites called cubesats as they drift away from the ISS to start their orbits around Earth. One of them is for the Kingdom of Bhutan, and it’s the nation’s first-ever satellite.

From Ritalin and Adderall to the twice-methylated Breaking Bad stuff, speed seduces both overbright founders and scurvy garage-dwellers. But it’s not the drug for right now. Speed is not only deadly; it’s defeatist.\\n\\nIt’s been two sobering years. We’d do well to take stock of what we were blind to in the raciest days of Silicon Valley and the government-as-usual Obama years. When the writer Casey Schwartz gave up Adderall after having it define her youth, she identified deep regrets: “I had spent years of my life in a state of false intensity, always wondering if I should be somewhere else, working harder, achieving more.” America is plenty intense—and it requires more freethinking from its citizens now than ever. It’s time for a reckoning with reality, reflection and reform, principled action. It’s also a time for civil disobedience. As grandiose as Adderall makes some people feel, the history of amphetamine as a drug of subjugation—used to compel obedience in soldiers, dieters, and unruly kids—haunts it.\\n\\nIn 1933, 46 years after Lazăr Edeleanu, a Romanian chemist, fatefully synthesized amphetamine—a mix of mirror-image molecules, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine—Smith, Kline & French picked it up and sold it as Benzedrine. Wouldn’t you know, enterprising hacker-tweakers soon prised open the inhalers, liberated the speed-soaked cotton strips, and swallowed them.\\n\\nBenzedrine as an “alertness aid” then shipped out to war. Months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the drug was, quite literally, weaponized. Military commanders, writes Nicolas Rasmussen in On Speed: From Benzedrine to Adderall, greatly feared another humiliating epidemic of “shell shock” like the one that had crippled the Allied armies of World War I. To keep soldiers looking on the bright side of war, armies began provisioning the men with amphetamines. Psychiatrists on the battlefield rechristened shell shock “operational fatigue,” and soldiers were relieved to hear they had a manly sounding physical ailment, eminently treatable with more Benzedrine. Get back out there, Private.\\n\\nCombat itself was changed by speed. Speedfreak servicemen of the 1940s made for gung-ho, wild-eyed fighters as the drug supplied them with fool’s courage. They hurled themselves into battle where they might otherwise have been held back by less thrilling but more adaptive human traits: anxiety, prudence, conscience. Commanders liked what they saw, and kept their men dosed.\\n\\nWhen the soldiers came home, many were addicted, and their wives were the nation’s next good soldiers. They reproduced the logic of the battlefields: They sucked down amphetamines to wage war on bodies—their own. The postwar obsession with thinness developed in tandem with the speed trade. By the end of the ’60s, 9.7 million Americans used prescription amphetamines. Of those, hundreds of thousands were addicted. The everyday tweakers jittered along, subduing their fears and hungers with the pep pills that were now dyed and looked like candy.\\n\\nIn 1968, after speed killed a dieting woman, an investigative journalist for Life magazine, Susanna McBee, published a bombshell exposé about the overprescription of pills for weight loss. McBee made a tour of doctors’ offices, and—after cursory interviews—was able to cop bags and bags of darling little tablets. Of course McBee had no weight to lose. But the drug trade now battened on the styling of female flesh as a disease.\\n\\nFrom soldiers to dieters to children. After McBee’s article, and more deaths traced to diet pills, weight-loss speed became more tightly regulated. But speed changed shape. Just as “operational fatigue” and “flesh” had been styled as pathologies, distractibility got a pharmaworld makeover—and became ADHD. Ritalin prescriptions for kids took off in the 1990s. By 2011, 3.5 million children in the US were on stimulants. A recent formulation, Adzenys, is aimed at first graders and up: It’s orange-\\xadflavored and melts in your mouth.\\n\\nSpeed can give kids a wonderful A-student experience. Of course parents want their kids to have that. To know the pleasures of conformity is a kind of bliss; those who pretend otherwise must never have feared that their eccentricities would disqualify them from life. But eventually the wandering mind, the hunger, and the anxiety return.\\n\\nSpeed gooses certain receptors to fake a body out, making it feel tight, urgent, self-important. On speed, you tend to embrace monotonous chores, especially asocial or servile ones, like arid sessions of dusting or coding, as the tiny muscles that line the walls of blood vessels contract. Speed also curbs mucus, while relaxing the lungs. So while users have symptoms of fear that may read as excitement, they also breathe easier.\\n\\nYou’d do well to lay off the starch and read some Betty Friedan on the slavery of scut work.\\n\\nEventually, though, congestion returns. The mortal coil tightens. When it does, you may wonder: Why am I taking apart iPads and starching sheets? Good question, and you’d do well to lay off the starch and read some Betty Friedan on the slavery of scut work. Also, sleep. But if speed calls you back, it’s because the power to rise to social demands that elude undrugged brains—that just feels too good.\\n\\nIt’s not immoral to want relief from being too slow, scared, and fat—too disappointing to your commanders. But chasing relief with speed could set you up for brain damage and psychosis. Worse, under the guise of fraud liberation, it locks you into life-\\xaddraining repetition. You think you’re being gloriously “productive”—even if what you’re producing is expense reports and Fortnite kills—without noticing that you’re missing the reasons for being: food, books, reflection, reform, engagement, adventure, rest, and meaningful work.\\n\\nWhy would anyone submit to this? Years ago, I stumbled upon an illustration of meth’s effects in Donna Tartt’s The Little Friend. Danny takes a hit and “Tears rose to his eyes. The icy, disinfectant taste at the back of his throat made him feel clean: everything surface again, everything sparkle on the glossy face of these waters which swept like thunder over a cesspool he was sick to death of: poverty, grease and rot.”\\n\\nI tried Ritalin in graduate school. I did manage term-\\xadpaper all-nighters under its influence, and stopped eating; I had the sense that people like bosses were pleased with undernourished, industrious me, that I was doing well by them. But the tensing of blood-vessel muscles evidently reads to my body not as euphoria but as a kind of stifled misery, and sometimes I’d mistake my loss of appetite for grief. More precisely: High on speed, I felt as though someone I loved dearly had recently died. Worse still, I felt too important and prolific to mourn, or even care.\\n\\nVirginia Heffernan (@page88) is a regular contributor to WIRED.

       " 'Defense Distributed, an Austin-based company notorious for 3-D printing a gun, recently won its risky landmark case against the federal government, allowing it to host digital gun designs on the internet. Though a federal judge blocked the ruling with a temporary injunction earlier this month, if the company’s legal strategy holds, it verges on mad genius. The reasoning: If a well-accepted First Amendment protects bits in the form of speech and code, and a contested Second Amendment protects atoms in the form of guns, then by turning guns into code (ie, atoms into bits) we get First Amendment protection for guns too.\\n\\nAntonio García Martínez (@antoniogm) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Previously he worked on Facebook’s early monetization team, where he headed its targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year.\\n\\nThis Defense Distributed story—with its confusing twists into First Amendment jurisprudence, computer-controlled manufacturing, and 3-D printing (and more on that in a moment)—cannot be fully understood without understanding the past half-century in firearms innovation. This new technology is completely undermining the way we’ve traditional regulated guns, and will overturn our nation’s longstanding political compromise around them.\\n\\nBut first, what is a gun exactly?\\n\\nThe revolver above is my grandfather’s Smith and Wesson .38 Police Special (inherited), once the standard police sidearm. It’s a forged hunk of metal, and close to nothing on it can be modified without serious gunsmithing—and, even then, it’ll never be more than a medium-frame, six-shot revolver.\\n\\nRed - gun. Green - not gun Antonio Garcia-Martinez\\n\\nLet’s fast-forward to the present.\\n\\nThis is a disassembled AR15. It is modular in every way, and every bit of it can be swapped out like so many Legos. Whatever your opinions on gun control, the AR15 is a masterpiece of open source, modular design—by changing out a part for one with a similar function but different design, both military and civilian owners can endlessly modify it into almost anything, from a submachine gun to a sniper rifle.\\n\\nRed - gun. Green - not gun Antonio Garcia-Martinez\\n\\nYou might ask: If the modern military weapon is just Legos, then what part is the “gun,” the specific piece of hardware with unique rules around sales and ownership that makes it different from, say, a chainsaw or blender?\\n\\nThe federal bureaucrat responds: The “gun” is the thing with the serial numbers on it. In the case of AR-pattern rifles, that’s what’s known as the lower receiver (or just “lower”). It’s the lower part that encases the rifle’s action, where the pistol grip attaches and a magazine goes in.\\n\\nEverything else is an accessory, even though it actually does the work of a gun, namely loading a cartridge into the action, striking the primer, which ignites the gunpowder, launching the projectile and hot gasses out of the barrel, and, finally, getting ready to do so again.\\n\\nThis is the official “gun” part of an AR. Everything else is really, truly, not considered a “gun.”\\n\\nThe decision to anoint the lower receiver a gun is a momentous bureaucratic decision. It means that everything in the “non-gun” category, which is most of the actual gun, can be bought and sold unrestricted online, like so many shoes on Zappos. Right now, you can buy everything in the “non-gun” category with zero checks online.\\n\\nParticularly in light of the initial discussion around advanced manufacturing, you might ask: If the “gun” is this relatively small piece of metal or polymer, then why can’t I make it myself somehow?\\n\\nLet’s answer that via a thought experiment:\\n\\nSay I took a rectangular hunk of aluminum and machined out a hole like the magazine well of the AR.\\n\\nThen I machined out the trigger opening.\\n\\nThen I machined out the base where the pistol grip attaches and every other detail in the “gun” part (see graphic).\\n\\nAt what point did the hunk of metal become a “gun”?\\n\\nThis isn’t mere philosophizing. It’s a real issue in gun regulation. The federal bureaucrat responds again: That piece of aluminum became the “gun” when you got 81 percent of the way to finishing it. After that point, it must be bought and sold as a gun, with all the restrictions that apply.\\n\\nWhat does the enormous US market in gun parts do? It sells you an 80 percent finished piece of metal, which is officially not a “gun” (though it really looks like one) on the internet, no questions asked (link provided for reference, not an endorsement). This is known in the gun world as an “80 percent lower.”\\n\\nThe aspiring unregistered gun owner then finishes the last 20 percent at home, with a drill press and/or a milling machine. Combined with the “non-gun” parts bought freely online, they now have a fully functioning AR15. Nobody knows that gun exists, and it is completely untraceable.\\n\\nSome retailers (such as the one linked above) offer you the entire package: every non-gun piece required and an 80 percent finished “gun” (again, really just the lower receiver), plus they’ll even include some machining jigs to make the finishing easier. This is the IKEA model of firearms, which even has its own IKEA Effect: New gun owners feel disproportionately attached to a gun they “made,” even though really they just put it together, often with the same hex keys you’d use on an IKEA bookshelf. Anyone with a credit card and address can buy this, and nobody on the planet is the wiser, save the retailer, who is not required to report anything, since they’re just selling “accessories.”\\n\\nThe entire gun debate is really about that last 20 percent of the bureaucratic “gun,” and how and where it happens. This is where Defense Distributed really comes in. They sell you a gadget that makes that last 20 percent step easier than doing it yourself, via a computer-controlled milling technology that’s been around forever. It isn’t a fundamentally new gun technology, but it is an important last-mile advance.\\n\\nI mention 3-D printing nowhere. That’s because it’s irrelevant, and most of what you read about 3-D-printed guns is noise. 3-D printing is a relatively immature manufacturing technology, and it won’t be making a modern, repeating firearm any time soon. (At least not the home 3-D printers that are cheaply available.) The only reason 3-D printing is even in the story is because Defense Distributed, geniuses at marketing, created a toy 3-D-printed product that could fire one round (before maybe exploding in your hand) as a way to plant the meme in the heads of people (and politicians) who know nothing about guns.\\n\\nSo why is everyone freaking out, including the attorneys general of several states that are suing Defense Distributed to stop? First, they are misunderstanding the technology, and believing Star Trek replicator fantasies around 3-D printing and guns. Second, and more seriously, advances in gun modularity and manufacturing now make most gun regulation obsolete.\\n\\nTo understand why technologies like those of Defense Distributed are poised to make gun regulation obsolete, we have to understand how gun regulation historically worked. In states like California and New York that wish to limit access to dangerous weapons, regulation has focused on certain features associated with military-style firearms, like pistol grips, quick-release magazines, folding stocks, and so on. In a world where guns were largely static and hard to modify, and the existence of such features indicated whether they were destined for sporting or military use, this approach made sense.\\n\\nWith this new modularity of firearms, this has essentially already happened. Consider the .50 Barrett M107 sniper rifle. You may have seen the weapon in 2010’s Academy Award for Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker, where it’s used by US soldiers to eliminate Iraqi snipers from an astonishing distance. It fires a projectile the size of your thumb, and can kill a man from over a mile away. In spirit, the weapon is illegal in California. In actual fact, it’s legal with the right modifications that only slightly impact functionality. Gun regulation fails.\\n\\nWhy does this odd status quo exist?\\n\\nOur current gun laws are a necessary compromise among pro- and anti-gun extremes, plus a large middle that wants some gun control but not an outright ban. The NRA zealot is placated by Democratic rhetoric around banning only “weapons of war” paired with the technical knowledge that they can tolerably dodge most Blue State gun laws via the modular technology described above. The pro-gun-control Blue Staters are placated because politicians are “doing something,” and thanks mostly to ignorance about how modern guns work, think their gun laws are actually stopping the distribution of firearms when they increasingly resemble security theater.\\n\\nDefense Distributed’s ultimate goal is to kick the final, weak leg out from under this tenuous political agreement, and force a reckoning with the state of firearms technology. When the last-mile problem of untraceable, unregistered guns has finally been “solved,” even politicians can’t maintain the charade of effective gun control.\\n\\nWhether Defense Distributed manages to spark the conflict now or advancing technology eventually sparks it later, this country will come to a total impasse on guns in which the existing compromise becomes untenable. What then?\\n\\nFoundational ideological conflicts in this country have always been resolved by one side co-opting some feature of the federal government (for example, the US Army, the Supreme Court, ICE) to force the other side to accept its interpretation of the Constitution. Depending on the party in power, both Democrats and Republicans have attempted just that, such as by tightening gun laws via the Federal Assault Weapons Ban signed by Bill Clinton or, more recently, through failed attempts by House Republicans to expand concealed-carry rights nationally.\\n\\nAlternatively, faced with this and other divergent opinions on key issues like abortion and immigration, the union reverts to a pre–Civil War level of federalism, where the US becomes a loose association of states, and every state goes off their own constitutional interpretation. In that scenario, the Blue States pursue the gun-banning strategy, turning themselves into a US version of Canada. Their pro-gun residents will rail online about “From my cold, dead hands!” and then quietly move elsewhere (to some extent, this is already happening). The pro-gun states will maintain their pro-gun stance, whatever the gun violence rates may be.\\n\\nIt’ll be weird and inconsistent, but we’ll prefer this new awkward compromise to the alternatives: “Calexit,” another Civil War, or the dissolution of the 242-year-old experiment in democracy we call the United States of America.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"In a café on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a one-time videogame developer turned political theorist named Santiago Siri is trying to explain to me how his nonprofit startup, Democracy.Earth, aims to fix the world’s broken politics with the help of the blockchain. The conversation has already covered a dizzying amount of ground. We’ve discussed the emergence of the Westphalian order of nation-states in the 17th century, Russia’s interference in the 2016 US election, the total collapse of Venezuelan society, and Siri’s own experience of political corruption in his native Argentina. But he finally boils it all down to one short sentence. “We want to tokenize the like,” Siri says. At the center of the project is the creation of what he calls “political cryptocurrency”—blockchain-generated tokens that users of Democracy.Earth’s software can spend as votes. Siri grew up in Argentina, where he saw the effects of corruption on democracy first hand. Sasha Arutyunova The way Siri sees it, we have traded in the original liberating potential of the internet for sterile corporate serfdom. Our time spent online retweeting and upvoting and clicking on emojis serves mainly to help unaccountable corporations like Facebook, Google, and Twitter to better target us with advertising. Siri dreams of a new kind of social media platform on which we spend “vote tokens” that can do anything, from electing politicians and passing referendums to enacting the bylaws of a social club or establishing the business plan of a corporation. It’s democracy by click. The vision is a radical departure from the one-person, one-vote, once-every-year-or-two trip to the ballot box we are familiar with—and by which, in Siri’s view, we are so ill-served. Users of Democracy.Earth’s one-size-fits-all governance platform—code-named Sovereign—would have infinite flexibility to vote on any kind of topic or person, whenever they log on. In the Democracy.Earth future, every day will be election day, and the ballot will include anything that enough of us think should be there. In this perfect world, Siri argues, the supposedly unhackable and absolutely transparent blockchain will ensure that no centralized election authority is required to tabulate a vote, and no corrupt politician or gridlocked legislature can interfere with the popular mandate. But coming up with a superior form of voting technology is just the beginning; the larger, far more revolutionary goal is to devise a decentralized decisionmaking process that eliminates the necessity for any kind of central government at all. “We are not in the business of selling e-voting machines or helping modernize governments with internet voting,” Siri says. “We want to empower people down to the individual level without asking for the permission of governments.” If the dream of bitcoin, the token generated by Satoshi Nakamoto’s blockchain, was to free money from central bank control, then the dream of Sovereign is to free politics from central government control. Siri’s complicated, multilayered solution to democratic dysfunction raises a host of questions and paradoxes. There is no shortage of secure-voting-systems experts who believe that radical blockchain democracy could cause more problems than it solves, and is in fact an invitation to gaming and manipulation at odds with the idea of transparent, fraud-free voting. Still others question how Democracy.Earth plans to solve the gnarliest quandaries faced by any voting system: How does one simultaneously ensure transparency in the voting process while guaranteeing the anonymity of the voter? How can one enfranchise direct voting without running the risk of a feckless tyranny of the majority motivated by short-term passions making terrible decisions? But nothing raises more eyebrows than the jewel in Democracy.Earth’s crown: the vote token. Because—like bitcoin, like Ether, and like so many of the cryptocurrency tokens sold by blockchain startups in initial coin offerings, known as ICOs, to fund their own operations—the Democracy.Earth vote token has a financial value. According to Siri, early in 2018 Democracy.Earth raised $1.5 million in a vote-token “presale.” It has plans to mint “a maximum” of 500 million tokens, provisionally priced at 12 cents each, for a company valuation of $60 million. Democracy.Earth employees will be compensated for their labor with tokens. The bottom line: There will be a financial market for the mechanism that Democracy.Earth users employ to vote. And that’s a headscratcher. “Ask yourself,” says Joseph Kiniry, CEO of Free & Fair, a company that provides secure election services, “if combining the idea of an ICO and democratic elections sounds fishy or not.”\\n\\nThe Trojan horse that rolled through Buenos Aires in 2013 was designed, like its ancient Greek forebear, to catch the unsuspecting eye. Towed down the streets by a car, 20 feet high and exquisitely carpentered, it caused an immediate sensation. Kids ran alongside. An excited crowd gathered when it came to a halt in front of the Palace of the Argentina National Congress, the political heart of the South American country. Argentina's Partido de la Red—Party of the Internet—used a flamboyant Trojan horse to symbolize its entrance into the nation's politics. Courtesy of Santiago Siri The publicity stunt aimed to spread awareness of an upstart new force in Argentinan politics, the Partido de la Red. “Until then, we were just the guys from Twitter, the nerds, playing politics,” says Siri, a cofounder of the party. “But then everyone was like, ‘What the hell is that?’ People started taking selfies. It became a symbol of the campaign.” Partido de la Red means “Party of the Net”—as in, the internet. It was founded to represent the interests of an emerging generation of millennial, always-online activists thoroughly dissatisfied with decades of Argentina’s endemic political corruption and spectacular financial crises. Its affiliation with the internet was meant to signal faith in a new kind of collaborative democracy. One of its primary goals was to elect politicians who would commit to uphold decisions made by party members in open, online debates. No more closed-door maneuvering. No more voting according to who delivered the most cash. “We had one rule,” Siri says. “Obey the internet.” The Trojan Horse’s symbolism ran deep. Like the original equine that carried hidden Greek warriors into the city of Troy, it represented the idea that the Partido de la Red would sneak its way into the established order and wage war from the inside. But it was also a play on the computer world’s co-optation of the name. This party was a computer virus designed to breach the security of Argentinian politics. At first, things seemed to be going well. In its first attempt to contest an election, the party captured 1.2 percent of the national vote, considerably better, Siri says, than the 0.2 to 0.3 percent a new party usually gets. “We had a lot of followers online,” Siri says. “It became a movement. We got into the game.” “And then,” Siri says, “things started to get really strange.” Provocateurs began showing up at party meetings. Siri’s car tires were slashed. A shadowy character told him that a “donation” of a million pesos to a federal judge would magically solve his party’s registration problems. He discovered that “changing the system from within was not going to happen,” Siri says. “The system was going to change you first.” So instead of trying to infiltrate the old system, Siri decided to build an entirely new one. He started putting together his blockchain governance platform. In January 2015, he made his way to Mountain View, California, where he had 10 minutes to impress Sam Altman, president of legendary startup incubator Y Combinator. It wasn’t going well. Siri remembers being “super nervous.” When Altman asked him a question about how many users the fledgling enterprise might eventually have, “I invented a number out of thin air.” The 10-minute window was closing fast. Then he showed Altman Instagram pictures of the Trojan horse. “They were like, ‘What!? What did you do!?,’” Siri says with a smile. “They loved us.”\\n\\nDemocracy.Earth’s white paper, “The Social Smart Contract,” is a tract that is equal parts crypto-libertarian manifesto and a technology road map for Sovereign. When stripped of its rhetoric (“The internet is incompatible with the nation-state,” “Representative democracies are an accident of the information technologies of the 18th century”), it breaks down into half a dozen major pieces. In addition to the blockchain and vote tokens, there is also a flexible ruleset for voting called “liquid democracy,” a complicated system for identity validation involving video selfies and “attention mining,” and even a version of a universal basic income scheme that will regularly “drip” new vote tokens into the accounts of Sovereign users. Fully explicating the potential and pitfalls of any single element of Democracy.Earth’s technology requires a lengthy journey into mostly unmapped territory. Consider, just for starters, the concept of “liquid democracy”—an approach to voting that is radically different from Western democratic electoral systems. In Sovereign’s scheme, users are allocated a stockpile of votes they can use (or spend) in a variety of ways. Siri approaches politics with the mindset of an engineer, meticulously tracking his ideas in notebooks. Sasha Arutyunova They can vote more than once on a particular topic, to express a heavier “weight” of intent. They can delegate their votes on a topic to trusted experts who are expected to understand the issue at hand in greater depth. They can even change their votes or retract their votes after the fact, if they change their minds on a subject or if they believe an elected representative has failed to deliver on their promises. Log on to the beta version of vote.democracy.earth for the first time, and you start off with 1,000 votes to do with as you please. A scroll of questions, action items, and ongoing debates occupies the center of the screen. Should there be a second Brexit vote? Should Venezuelan opposition leaders maintain dialogue with the repressive Maduro government? Do you think a universal basic income should be granted unconditionally? Liquid democracy is an always-on mashup between direct democracy and representative democracy. Voters are simultaneously constituents of multiple overlapping organizations: local, international, aspirational. In Siri’s imagination, dipping into liquid democracy’s never-ending flow will fit as naturally into the lives of the smartphone generation as checking Twitter or Instagram. Moritz Ritter, managing director of Berlin-based advocacy group Liquid Democracy, which is unaffiliated with Democracy.Earth but has been pushing similar ideas about how elections can be reimagined for years, says the purpose is “to take the current system of representative democracy and make it more responsive and distribute power more equally. In our view, this is necessary, because we see a growing disconnect between political actors and citizens manifested by shrinking numbers of members in political parties, dramatically shrinking voter turnout in elections, and growing mistrust of political systems.” “Democracy.Earth,” Ritter says, “is a really thorough approach for rethinking online voting and allocating political power without centralized institutions.” As described by Ritter, it’s easy to see the appeal of liquid democracy for a constituency dissatisfied with politics as currently practiced. But it may be a mistake to try to map what Democracy.Earth is doing directly to our current status quo. Whenever I asked Siri how exactly his technology would affect something like the emergence of Donald Trump in US politics or the authoritarianism of President Maduro in Venezuela or, in perhaps the most formidably dismaying scenario, the total power of the Chinese Communist Party, Siri would change the grounds of discussion away from the political exigencies of the moment and toward the contemplation of more ethereal, long-range goals. The internet and the blockchain, he believes, have smashed the old nation-state era to dust. In this new, profoundly globalized, borderless, and increasingly decentralized universe, we are no longer defined by our geographical location in a particular territory. Instead, we are citizens of the world, and in the future we will require the evolution of new, decentralized organizations aligned with the constraints of our new reality. Democracy.Earth, I gradually came to understand, is an ongoing research laboratory and thought experiment in how to design decisionmaking mechanisms appropriate to this new world. “Our aim is to provide a token that can be trusted for governance because of the legitimacy we can bring in regarding identity validation and liquid democracy rules,” Siri says. “I think we are discovering the building blocks for creating purely digital institutions—institutions that never need to go through a bureaucracy or a bank or a state in order to exist.”\\n\\nThe proposition that new solutions are necessary for our strange new world is hard to argue against. The problem lies in proving that something as complex as Democracy.Earth fixes more than it breaks. Consider the most fundamental piece of Sovereign’s infrastructure, the blockchain. The case for the application of the blockchain to voting systems is that blockchains are supposed to be perfectly transparent scorekeepers that can’t be hacked by Russian bots or bought off by Super PAC fund-raising or corrupt Argentine politicos. The immutability of a “distributed ledger” shared on multiple computers is an article of faith in the crypto community. Using Sovereign, Siri says, voters will be able to track their votes on the blockchain; they will know without any doubt that their vote was cast and counted as intended. Herb Stephens, a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur who serves as Democracy.Earth’s treasurer, says the goal is a system in which “everyone has a copy and everyone can monitor the things that matter to the public in general.” Or, as the white paper puts it, “with a blockchain-based democracy votes become censorship-resistant and every single voter can audit an election without requiring any kind of access rights to infrastructure.” Experts in secure voting systems disagree. “It is a terrible mismatch for the voting and election space,” says Josh Benaloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft Research who has spent 30 years researching secure voting systems. “It seems attractive, until you scratch under the surface. There are so many ways in which blockchains don’t solve the real problems, they just make everything worse.” Dan Wallach, a professor specializing in computer security at Rice University, believes that the crypto-infatuated generation is far too optimistic about what their new toys can achieve. “Blockchain people haven’t really been paying attention to the threat models inherent in voting, particularly bribery and coercion,” Wallach says. “They tend to make naive assumptions about voters’ ability to control the cryptographic keys and software used to express their votes. None of these systems are suitable for use in real-world municipal elections.” Wallach and Benaloh both reiterated the classic “garbage in, garbage out” problem that has long afflicted computer programming. Certainly, once things are recorded on the blockchain it is very hard to change them. (As Harper Reed, Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign chief technology officer, told me, “the blockchain is great for knowing whether people are messing with your stuff.”) But Benaloh is worried about vulnerabilities that occur before data is encoded in the blockchain. There could be malware on your smartphone that alters your vote as soon as you try to spend your token. Even worse, there could be an agent of a repressive state with a gun to your head dictating exactly how you vote. Or, your vote could just get bought—something that some researchers think will be even easier on the blockchain than at the old-school ballot box. Although Democracy.Earth intends for Sovereign to ultimately be “blockchain-agnostic”—that is, it should be compatible with a multitude of different public and private blockchains—right now it is being designed to take advantage of the “smart contract” capabilities built into the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts automatically execute transactions on the blockchain when certain conditions written into the blockchain’s code are met. Sovereign’s vote tokens, therefore, can automatically trigger smart contracts. For example, an organization debating whether to spend funds on a particular project holds a vote; if a majority spends their tokens voting yes, the funds are instantly released. But in a system where the decisionmaking entity—the vote token—is itself something bearing a financial value, the potential for smart-contract mayhem is enormous, says Ari Juels, a Cornell Tech computer scientist who studies blockchains and smart contracts. In early July, Juels coauthored a blog post pointing out that smart contracts could be equally as effective at “buying elections” as they would be properly executing the results of an election. “The Democracy.Earth scheme offers a clear and simple illustration of the type of attack we’re concerned about,” Juels writes in an email. “Very simply, someone can anonymously launch a smart contract that buys people’s votes by purchasing their Democracy.Earth voting tokens. The broader point is that the very transparency of blockchains can be a liability in elections, as it exposes the choices of voters. Smart contracts can automate vote buying, guarantee payment, and otherwise undermine election integrity. The white paper suggests that the connection between identities and cast votes might be broken using new techniques. But breaking this connection when a voter wants it in place in order to sell her vote is hard.” “I hold the same opinion as the rest of the international experts in crypto and elections,” says Kiniri of Free & Fair.1 “There are nearly only ‘cons’ to using blockchain technology in the voting process.”\\n\\nThe son of a corporate lawyer and slipper company entrepreneur, Siri grew up in Buenos Aires, idolizing both Steve Jobs and Che Guevara. Before getting involved in Argentinian politics, he carved out a successful niche as a videogame designer, launching two game companies as well as cofounding a game developer association. He dreamed, he tells me, of building a game like SimCity, “only with actual citizens.” He jumped on the blockchain bandwagon early, although he notes, just a tad ruefully, “I wish I bought more.” “But I bought enough,” he concludes. Santiago Siri photographed in New York City in August 2018. Sasha Arutyunova As far as his own politics are concerned, Siri says that he’s been “introduced in different places around the world as either a revolutionary leftist or a Davos-man entrepreneur engaging in politics. Both are flattering to me.” There’s no question he’s hard to put in a box. Every conversation I had with Siri was a roller-coaster: Game theory, the quantum nature of reality, the failure of the Bolshevik revolution, the internet’s responsibility for the polarization of our current information ecology—in real time, you can feel Siri restlessly trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together. He’s a big thinker, tackling problems that are as big as they get. But the more we delved into the nitty-gritty of Democracy.Earth’s technology, the more difficult it became to evaluate its objective merits. When I pointed Siri toward Juel’s blog post about smart-contract vote-buying and shared Benaloh’s critique of the blockchain as applied to real-world elections, his answers took me further into the labyrinth. “Of course there are all kinds of concerns as we expand our understanding of how to architect systems built only with information,” he wrote via email. “We are aware of the diverse set of attacks that can happen. But voting isn’t a uni-dimensional problem. It’s just the name we give to transactions happening within the wider realm of governance. Elections, as we understand them under the traditional sense on how they’ve been held by the nation-state, are probably not the fittest form of governance to be delivered in digital form ... That’s why intrinsically understanding how blockchains can scale social consensus is definitely the way to go.” What Siri seemed to be saying is that Sovereign isn’t really intended as a replacement for how the United States elects a president or California passes an initiative. Instead, it's really an exercise in figuring out how to use the blockchain to make group decisions in the crypto-digital domain. Sovereign, in other words, represents government of the crypto-people, by the crypto-people, and for the crypto-people. Ultimately, maybe, the crypto-people will soon just be the people. But we’re not there yet. Underlying everything in the Democracy.Earth platform, and more generally in the whole crypto-libertarian project to remake society into a decentralized utopia free of coercion and exploitation, is a near-evangelical faith in the premise that computer code can solve the messy realities of human life. “The interesting thing about crypto,” Siri says, “is that you can start creating institutional models that no longer rely on the fallibility of human authority but are strictly based on code, mathematics, and encryption; you can start building an institutional reality where the checks and balances are protected by hard promises, by fundamental mathematical constructs that are simply impossible to break due to the intrinsic properties of how information works.” This is a difficult argument to challenge by picking away at potential smart contract vulnerabilities, or any other objective critique of the blockchain as it exists now, because the answer to every problem is a new technological solution that just hasn’t been discovered yet. And it’s an impossible argument to challenge by pointing out such things as the possibility that a centralized database with really strong security provisions is probably a more efficient way to run an election than by using the blockchain, when the whole point of the project is to avoid having a central authority in the first place.\\n\\nA primitive version of Sovereign was tested during the 2016 Colombian referendum held to approve a peace treaty between the government and the FARC rebels. One thousand expatriate Colombians who were unable to register to vote in the actual election took part. In a preliminary stab at implementing the flexibility of liquid democracy, the trial group was given the opportunity to cast a symbolic vote on seven different propositions relating to the peace accord, rather than just a binary yes/no on whether to pass the accord. Siri says the approach helped explain the surprise real-world defeat of the accord, because the Sovereign-using voters approved six of the peace-related proposals, while overwhelmingly rejecting a proposal to allow FARC to participate in government. As an experiment in how voting could be conducted with more nuance than conventional models, the FARC referendum is interesting. But it still falls short as proof of how a full-fledged Sovereign exercise of vote-token fueled liquid democracy might work, because too many pieces of the puzzle still remain in development. Most critically, there has been, to date, no real-world test of the use of Sovereign’s blockchain generated vote tokens. And that is precisely where the whole Democracy.Earth experiment is most provocative. The main reason voting-technology researchers cast a leery eye on the merger of cryptocurrency and voting stems directly from the example of bitcoin, which evolved from means of exchange to speculative commodity. Instead of being used to actually buy things, bitcoin has turned into the digital equivalent of gold—a way to get rich by simply buying and selling when the price is right. So what’s to stop “owners” of vote tokens from buying and selling them as commodities instead of using them to vote? Siri and Stephens both acknowledge that the potential for vote-token speculation is a real concern. At the very moment I was posing them the question in early July, the entire Democracy.Earth team held a one-week retreat to figure out how to guard against exactly such a scenario. After the retreat was over, Siri sent me a preliminary draft of their new “token economics” white paper. Along with another dollop of rhetoric—“we consider token-based liquid democracies to be the most flexible form of democratic governance that can be constructed with digital technology”—the paper made a pledge that Sovereign’s vote tokens would be built with incentives designed to keep token prices stable. Like many elements of the Democracy.Earth technology roadmap (and this is a common aspect of ICO white papers) the goal sounded more aspirational than grounded in executable code. But two different academic cryptocurrency researchers with whom I discussed the plan said they were hard put to figure out why a vote token had to have monetary value in the first place. One suggested that the primary motivation was likely “business reasons”—that is, funding ongoing operations or, more simply, profit. Even worse, to participate in this form of voting, you have to be able to afford the vote token in the first place. Someone has to cover the cost of computation on a public blockchain. In the world of old school politics, “paying to play” is generally frowned upon. Perhaps in theory Democracy.Earth’s outline of a universal basic income scheme could address that issue, but that’s also another example of adding complexity to an already Rube Goldbergian contraption. Siri’s rejoinder is that there has to be some real skin in the game to make online voting meaningful. “The purpose of using a blockchain is for decisions that aim to be immutable, and hence able to trigger cryptocurrency transactions or execute smart contracts,” Siri says. “Our aim is to evolve the experience using social media into something that is effectively able to push institutional change with transactions that are backed by economic drivers brought in by the users themselves.” In other words, paying to play is a good thing.\",\n",
       " \"It was a perfect sunny summer afternoon in Copenhagen when the world’s largest shipping conglomerate began to lose its mind. The headquarters of A.P. Møller-Maersk sits beside the breezy, cobblestoned esplanade of Copenhagen’s harbor. A ship’s mast carrying the Danish flag is planted by the building’s northeastern corner, and six stories of blue-tinted windows look out over the water, facing a dock where the Danish royal family parks its yacht. In the building’s basement, employees can browse a corporate gift shop, stocked with Maersk-branded bags and ties, and even a rare Lego model of the company’s gargantuan Triple-E container ship, a vessel roughly as large as the Empire State Building laid on its side, capable of carrying another Empire State Building–sized load of cargo stacked on top of it. That gift shop also houses a technology help center, a single desk manned by IT troubleshooters next to the shop’s cashier. And on the afternoon of June 27, 2017, confused Maersk staffers began to gather at that help desk in twos and threes, almost all of them carrying laptops. On the machines’ screens were messages in red and black lettering. Some read “repairing file system on C:” with a stark warning not to turn off the computer. Others, more surreally, read “oops, your important files are encrypted” and demanded a payment of $300 worth of bitcoin to decrypt them. September 2018. Subscribe to WIRED. Mike McQuade Across the street, an IT administrator named Henrik Jensen was working in another part of the Maersk compound, an ornate white-stone building that in previous centuries had served as the royal archive of maritime maps and charts. (Henrik Jensen is not his real name. Like almost every Maersk employee, customer, or partner I interviewed, Jensen feared the consequences of speaking publicly for this story.) Jensen was busy preparing a software update for Maersk’s nearly 80,000 employees when his computer spontaneously restarted. He quietly swore under his breath. Jensen assumed the unplanned reboot was a typically brusque move by Maersk’s central IT department, a little-loved entity in England that oversaw most of the corporate empire, whose eight business units ranged from ports to logistics to oil drilling, in 574 offices in 130 countries around the globe. Jensen looked up to ask if anyone else in his open-plan office of IT staffers had been so rudely interrupted. And as he craned his head, he watched every other computer screen around the room blink out in rapid succession. “I saw a wave of screens turning black. Black, black, black. Black black black black black,” he says. The PCs, Jensen and his neighbors quickly discovered, were irreversibly locked. Restarting only returned them to the same black screen. About the Author Andy Greenberg (@a_greenberg) is a WIRED senior writer. This story is excerpted from his book Sandworm, forthcoming from Doubleday. All across Maersk headquarters, the full scale of the crisis was starting to become clear. Within half an hour, Maersk employees were running down hallways, yelling to their colleagues to turn off computers or disconnect them from Maersk’s network before the malicious software could infect them, as it dawned on them that every minute could mean dozens or hundreds more corrupted PCs. Tech workers ran into conference rooms and unplugged machines in the middle of meetings. Soon staffers were hurdling over locked key-card gates, which had been paralyzed by the still-mysterious malware, to spread the warning to other sections of the building. Disconnecting Maersk’s entire global network took the company’s IT staff more than two panicky hours. By the end of that process, every employee had been ordered to turn off their computer and leave it at their desk. The digital phones at every cubicle, too, had been rendered useless in the emergency network shutdown. Around 3 pm, a Maersk executive walked into the room where Jensen and a dozen or so of his colleagues were anxiously awaiting news and told them to go home. Maersk’s network was so deeply corrupted that even IT staffers were helpless. A few of the company’s more old-school managers told their teams to remain at the office. But many employees—rendered entirely idle without computers, servers, routers, or desk phones—simply left. Jensen walked out of the building and into the warm air of a late June afternoon. Like the vast majority of Maersk staffers, he had no idea when he might return to work. The maritime giant that employed him, responsible for 76 ports on all sides of the earth and nearly 800 seafaring vessels, including container ships carrying tens of millions of tons of cargo, representing close to a fifth of the entire world’s shipping capacity, was dead in the water. Mike Mcquade\\n\\nOn the edge of the trendy Podil neighborhood in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, coffee shops and parks abruptly evaporate, replaced by a grim industrial landscape. Under a highway overpass, across some trash-strewn railroad tracks, and through a concrete gate stands the four-story headquarters of Linkos Group, a small, family-run Ukrainian software business. Up three flights of stairs in that building is a server room, where a rack of \\xadpizza-box-sized computers is connected by a tangle of wires and marked with handwritten, numbered labels. On a normal day, these servers push out routine updates—bug fixes, security patches, new features—to a piece of accounting software called M.E.Doc, which is more or less Ukraine’s equivalent of TurboTax or Quicken. It’s used by nearly anyone who files taxes or does business in the country. But for a moment in 2017, those machines served as ground zero for the most devastating cyberattack since the invention of the internet—an attack that began, at least, as an assault on one nation by another. For the past four and a half years, Ukraine has been locked in a grinding, undeclared war with Russia that has killed more than 10,000 Ukrainians and displaced millions more. The conflict has also seen Ukraine become a scorched-earth testing ground for Russian cyberwar tactics. In 2015 and 2016, while the Kremlin-linked hackers known as Fancy Bear were busy breaking into the US Democratic National Committee’s servers, another group of agents known as Sandworm was hacking into dozens of Ukrainian governmental organizations and companies. They penetrated the networks of victims ranging from media outlets to railway firms, detonating logic bombs that destroyed terabytes of data. The attacks followed a sadistic seasonal cadence. In the winters of both years, the saboteurs capped off their destructive sprees by causing widespread power outages—the first confirmed blackouts induced by hackers. But those attacks still weren’t Sandworm’s grand finale. In the spring of 2017, unbeknownst to anyone at Linkos Group, Russian military hackers hijacked the company’s update servers to allow them a hidden back door into the thousands of PCs around the country and the world that have M.E.Doc installed. Then, in June 2017, the saboteurs used that back door to release a piece of malware called \\xadNotPetya, their most vicious cyberweapon yet. Related Stories How An Entire Nation Became Russia's Test Lab for Cyberwar\\n\\nFacebook's Mandatory Malware Scan Is an Intrusive Mess\\n\\nInside the Takedown of a Notorious Malware Clearinghouse The code that the hackers pushed out was honed to spread automatically, rapidly, and indiscriminately. “To date, it was simply the fastest-propagating piece of malware we’ve ever seen,” says Craig Williams, director of outreach at Cisco’s Talos division, one of the first security companies to reverse engineer and analyze Not\\xadPetya. “By the second you saw it, your data center was already gone.” NotPetya was propelled by two powerful hacker exploits working in tandem: One was a penetration tool known as EternalBlue, created by the US National Security Agency but leaked in a disastrous breach of the agency’s ultrasecret files earlier in 2017. EternalBlue takes advantage of a vulnerability in a particular Windows protocol, allowing hackers free rein to remotely run their own code on any unpatched machine. NotPetya’s architects combined that digital skeleton key with an older invention known as Mimikatz, created as a proof of concept by French security researcher Benjamin Delpy in 2011. Delpy had originally released Mimikatz to demonstrate that Windows left users’ passwords lingering in computers’ memory. Once hackers gained initial access to a computer, Mimikatz could pull those passwords out of RAM and use them to hack into other machines accessible with the same credentials. On networks with multiuser computers, it could even allow an automated attack to hopscotch from one machine to the next. Before NotPetya’s launch, Microsoft had released a patch for its EternalBlue vulnerability. But EternalBlue and Mimikatz together nonetheless made a virulent combination. “You can infect computers that aren’t patched, and then you can grab the passwords from those computers to infect other computers that are patched,” Delpy says. NotPetya took its name from its resemblance to the ransomware Petya, a piece of criminal code that surfaced in early 2016 and extorted victims to pay for a key to unlock their files. But NotPetya’s ransom messages were only a ruse: The malware’s goal was purely destructive. It irreversibly encrypted computers’ master boot records, the deep-seated part of a machine that tells it where to find its own operating system. Any ransom payment that victims tried to make was futile. No key even existed to reorder the scrambled noise of their computer’s contents. The weapon’s target was Ukraine. But its blast radius was the entire world. “It was the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory,” Bossert says. The release of NotPetya was an act of cyberwar by almost any definition—one that was likely more explosive than even its creators intended. Within hours of its first appearance, the worm raced beyond Ukraine and out to countless machines around the world, from hospitals in Pennsylvania to a chocolate factory in Tasmania. It \\xadcrippled multinational companies including Maersk, pharmaceutical giant Merck, FedEx’s European subsidiary TNT Express, French construction company Saint-Gobain, food producer Mondelēz, and manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser. In each case, it inflicted nine-figure costs. It even spread back to Russia, striking the state oil company Rosneft. The result was more than $10 billion in total damages, according to a White House assessment confirmed to WIRED by former Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert, who at the time of the attack was President Trump’s most senior cybersecurity-\\xadfocused official. Bossert and US intelligence agencies also confirmed in February that Russia’s military—the prime suspect in any cyberwar attack targeting Ukraine—was responsible for launching the malicious code. (The Russian foreign ministry declined to answer repeated requests for comment.) To get a sense of the scale of NotPetya’s damage, consider the nightmarish but more typical ransomware attack that paralyzed the city government of Atlanta this past March: It cost up to $10 million, a tenth of a percent of NotPetya’s price. Even WannaCry, the more notorious worm that spread a month before NotPetya in May 2017, is estimated to have cost between $4 billion and $8 billion. Nothing since has come close. “While there was no loss of life, it was the equivalent of using a nuclear bomb to achieve a small tactical victory,” Bossert says. “That’s a degree of recklessness we can’t tolerate on the world stage.” In the year since NotPetya shook the world, WIRED has delved into the experience of one corporate goliath brought to its knees by Russia’s worm: Maersk, whose malware fiasco uniquely demonstrates the danger that cyberwar now poses to the infrastructure of the modern world. The executives of the shipping behemoth, like every other non-Ukrainian victim WIRED approached to speak about NotPetya, declined to comment in any official capacity for this story. WIRED’s account is instead assembled from current and former Maersk sources, many of whom chose to remain anonymous. But the story of NotPetya isn’t truly about Maersk, or even about Ukraine. It’s the story of a nation-state’s weapon of war released in a medium where national borders have no meaning, and where collateral damage travels via a cruel and unexpected logic: Where an attack aimed at Ukraine strikes Maersk, and an attack on Maersk strikes everywhere at once.\\n\\nOleksii Yasinsky expected a calm Tuesday at the office. It was the day before Ukraine’s Constitution Day, a national holiday, and most of his coworkers were either planning their vacations or already taking them. But not Yasinsky. For the past year he’d been the head of the cyber lab at Information Systems Security Partners, a company that was quickly becoming the go-to firm for victims of Ukraine’s cyberwar. That job description didn’t lend itself to downtime. Since the first blows of Russia’s cyberattacks hit in late 2015, in fact, he’d allowed himself a grand total of one week off. So Yasinsky was unperturbed when he received a call that morning from ISSP’s director telling him that Oschadbank, the second-largest bank in Ukraine, was under attack. The bank had told ISSP that it was facing a ransomware infection, an increasingly common crisis for companies around the world targeted by profit-focused cybercriminals. But when Yasinsky walked into Oschadbank’s IT department at its central Kiev office half an hour later, he could tell this was something new. “The staff were lost, confused, in a state of shock,” Yasinsky says. Around 90 percent of the bank’s thousands of computers were locked, showing NotPetya’s “repairing disk” messages and ransom screens. After a quick examination of the bank’s surviving logs, Yasinsky could see that the attack was an automated worm that had somehow obtained an administrator’s credentials. That had allowed it to rampage through the bank’s network like a prison inmate who has stolen the warden’s keys. As he analyzed the bank’s breach back in ISSP’s office, Yasinsky started receiving calls and messages from people around Ukraine, telling him of similar instances in other companies and government agencies. One told him that another victim had attempted to pay the ransom. As Yasinsky suspected, the payment had no effect. This was no ordinary ransomware. “There was no silver bullet for this, no antidote,” he says. The Cost of NotPetya In 2017, the malware NotPetya spread from the servers of an unassuming Ukrainian software firm to some of the largest businesses worldwide, paralyzing their operations. Here’s a list of the approximate damages reported by some of the worm’s biggest victims. $870,000,000 Pharmaceutical company Merck $400,000,000 Delivery company FedEx (through European subsidiary TNT Express) $384,000,000 French construction company Saint-Gobain $300,000,000 Danish shipping company Maersk $188,000,000 Snack company Mondelēz (parent company of Nabisco and Cadbury) $129,000,000 British manufacturer Reckitt Benckiser (owner of Lysol and Durex condoms) $10 billion Total damages from NotPetya, as estimated by the White House A thousand miles to the south, ISSP CEO Roman Sologub was attempting to take a Constitution Day vacation on the southern coast of Turkey, preparing to head to the beach with his family. His phone, too, began to explode with calls from ISSP clients who were either watching NotPetya tear across their networks or reading news of the attack and frantically seeking advice. Sologub retreated to his hotel, where he’d spend the rest of the day fielding more than 50 calls from customers reporting, one after another after another, that their networks had been infected. ISSP’s security operations center, which monitored the networks of clients in real time, warned Sologub that NotPetya was saturating victims’ systems with terrifying speed: It took 45 seconds to bring down the network of a large Ukrainian bank. A portion of one major Ukrainian transit hub, where ISSP had installed its equipment as a demonstration, was fully infected in 16 seconds. Ukrenergo, the energy company whose network ISSP had been helping to rebuild after the 2016 blackout cyberattack, had also been struck yet again. “Do you remember we were about to implement new security controls?” Sologub recalls a frustrated Ukrenergo IT director asking him on the phone. “Well, too late.” By noon, ISSP’s founder, a serial entrepreneur named Oleh Derevianko, had sidelined his vacation too. Derevianko was driving north to meet his family at his village house for the holiday when the NotPetya calls began. Soon he had pulled off the highway and was working from a roadside restaurant. By the early afternoon, he was warning every executive who called to unplug their networks without hesitation, even if it meant shutting down their entire company. In many cases, they’d already waited too long. “By the time you reached them, the infrastructure was already lost,” Derevianko says. On a national scale, NotPetya was eating Ukraine’s computers alive. It would hit at least four hospitals in Kiev alone, six power companies, two airports, more than 22 Ukrainian banks, ATMs and card payment systems in retailers and transport, and practically every federal agency. “The government was dead,” summarizes Ukrainian minister of infrastructure Volodymyr Omelyan. According to ISSP, at least 300 companies were hit, and one senior Ukrainian government official estimated that 10 percent of all computers in the country were wiped. The attack even shut down the computers used by scientists at the Chernobyl cleanup site, 60 miles north of Kiev. “It was a massive bombing of all our systems,” Omelyan says. When Derevianko emerged from the restaurant in the early evening, he stopped to refuel his car and found that the gas station’s credit card payment system had been taken out by NotPetya too. With no cash in his pockets, he eyed his gas gauge, wondering if he had enough fuel to reach his village. Across the country, Ukrainians were asking themselves similar questions: whether they had enough money for groceries and gas to last through the blitz, whether they would receive their paychecks and pensions, whether their prescriptions would be filled. By that night, as the outside world was still debating whether NotPetya was criminal ransom\\xadware or a weapon of state-sponsored cyberwar, ISSP’s staff had already started referring to it as a new kind of phenomenon: a “massive, coordinated cyber invasion.” Amid that epidemic, one single infection would become particularly fateful for Maersk: In an office in Odessa, a port city on Ukraine’s Black Sea coast, a finance executive for Maersk’s Ukraine operation had asked IT administrators to install the accounting software M.E.Doc on a single computer. That gave NotPetya the only foothold it needed.\\n\\nThe shipping terminal in Elizabeth, New Jersey—one of the 76 that make up the port-operations division of Maersk known as APM Terminals—sprawls out into Newark Bay on a man-made peninsula covering a full square mile. Tens of thousands of stacked, perfectly modular shipping containers cover its vast asphalt landscape, and 200-foot-high blue cranes loom over the bay. From the top floors of lower Manhattan’s skyscrapers, five miles away, they look like brachiosaurs gathered at a Jurassic-era watering hole. On a good day, about 3,000 trucks arrive at the terminal, each assigned to pick up or drop off tens of thousands of pounds of everything from diapers to avocados to tractor parts. They start that process, much like airline passengers, by checking in at the terminal’s gate, where scanners automatically read their container’s barcodes and a Maersk gate clerk talks to the truck driver via a speaker system. The driver receives a printed pass that tells them where to park so that a massive yard crane can haul their container from the truck’s chassis to a stack in the cargo yard, where it’s loaded onto a container ship and floated across an ocean—or that entire process in reverse order. On the morning of June 27, Pablo Fernández was expecting dozens of trucks’ worth of cargo to be shipped out from Elizabeth to a port in the Middle East. Fernández is a so-called freight forwarder—a middleman whom cargo owners pay to make sure their property arrives safely at a destination halfway around the world. (Fernández is not his real name.) At around 9 am New Jersey time, Fernández’s phone started buzzing with a succession of screaming calls from angry cargo owners. All of them had just heard from truck drivers that their vehicles were stuck outside Maersk’s Elizabeth terminal. “People were jumping up and down,” Fernández says. “They couldn’t get their containers in and out of the gate.” That gate, a choke point to Maersk’s entire New Jersey terminal operation, was dead. The gate clerks had gone silent. Soon, hundreds of 18-wheelers were backed up in a line that stretched for miles outside the terminal. One employee at another company’s nearby terminal at the same New Jersey port watched the trucks collect, bumper to bumper, farther than he could see. He’d seen gate systems go down for stretches of 15 minutes or half an hour before. But after a few hours, still with no word from Maersk, the Port Authority put out an alert that the company’s Elizabeth terminal would be closed for the rest of the day. “That’s when we started to realize,” the nearby terminal’s staffer remembers, “this was an attack.” Police began to approach drivers in their cabs, telling them to turn their massive loads around and clear out. Fernández and countless other frantic Maersk customers faced a set of bleak options: They could try to get their precious cargo onto other ships at premium, last-minute rates, often traveling the equivalent of standby. Or, if their cargo was part of a tight supply chain, like components for a factory, Maersk’s outage could mean shelling out for exorbitant air freight delivery or risk stalling manufacturing processes, where a single day of downtime costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. Many of the containers, known as reefers, were electrified and full of perishable goods that required refrigeration. They’d have to be plugged in somewhere or their contents would rot. Fernández had to scramble to find a New Jersey warehouse where he could stash his customers’ cargo while he waited for word from Maersk. During the entire first day, he says, he received only one official email, which read like “gibberish,” from a frazzled Maersk staffer’s Gmail account, offering no real explanation of the mounting crisis. The company’s central booking website, Maerskline.com, was down, and no one at the company was picking up their phones. Some of the containers he’d sent on Maersk’s ships that day would remain lost in cargo yards and ports around the world for the next three months. “Maersk was like a black hole,” Fernández remembers with a sigh. “It was just a clusterfuck.” In fact, it was a clusterfuck of clusterfucks. The same scene was playing out at 17 of Maersk’s 76 terminals, from Los Angeles to Algeciras, Spain, to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, to Mumbai. Gates were down. Cranes were frozen. Tens of thousands of trucks would be turned away from comatose terminals across the globe. No new bookings could be made, essentially cutting off Maersk’s core source of shipping revenue. The computers on Maersk’s ships weren’t infected. But the terminals’ software, designed to receive the Electronic Data Interchange files from those ships, which tell terminal operators the exact contents of their massive cargo holds, had been entirely wiped away. That left Maersk’s ports with no guide to perform the colossal Jenga game of loading and unloading their towering piles of containers. For days to come, one of the world’s most complex and interconnected distributed machines, underpinning the circulatory system of the global economy itself, would remain broken. “It was clear this problem was of a magnitude never seen before in global transport,” one Maersk customer remembers. “In the history of shipping IT, no one has ever gone through such a monumental crisis.” Mike McQuade\\n\\nSeveral days after his screen had gone dark in a corner of Maersk’s office, Henrik Jensen was at home in his Copenhagen apartment, enjoying a brunch of poached eggs, toast, and marmalade. Since he’d walked out of the office the Tuesday before, he hadn’t heard a word from any of his superiors. Then his phone rang. When he answered, he found himself on a conference call with three Maersk staffers. He was needed, they said, at Maersk’s office in Maidenhead, England, a town west of London where the conglomerate’s IT overlords, Maersk Group Infrastructure Services, were based. They told him to drop everything and go there. Immediately. Two hours later, Jensen was on a plane to London, then in a car to an eight-story glass-and-brick building in central Maidenhead. When he arrived, he found that the fourth and fifth floors of the building had been converted into a 24/7 emergency operations center. Its singular purpose: to rebuild Maersk’s global network in the wake of its NotPetya meltdown. Some Maersk staffers, Jensen learned, had been in the recovery center since Tuesday, when NotPetya first struck. Some had been sleeping in the office, under their desks or in corners of conference rooms. Others seemed to be arriving every minute from other parts of the world, luggage in hand. Maersk had booked practically every hotel room within tens of miles, every bed-and-breakfast, every spare room above a pub. Staffers were subsisting on snacks that someone had piled up in the office kitchen after a trip to a nearby Sainsbury’s grocery store. The Maidenhead recovery center was being managed by the consultancy Deloitte. Maersk had essentially given the UK firm a blank check to make its NotPetya problem go away, and at any given time as many as 200 Deloitte staffers were stationed in the Maidenhead office, alongside up to 400 Maersk personnel. All computer equipment used by Maersk from before NotPetya’s outbreak had been confiscated, for fear that it might infect new systems, and signs were posted threatening disciplinary action against anyone who used it. Instead, staffers had gone into every available electronics store in Maidenhead and bought up piles of new laptops and prepaid Wi-Fi hot spots. Jensen, like hundreds of other Maersk IT staffers, was given one of those fresh laptops and told to do his job. “It was very much just ‘Find your corner, get to work, do whatever needs to be done,’ ” he says. Early in the operation, the IT staffers rebuilding Maersk’s network came to a sickening realization. They had located backups of almost all of Maersk’s individual servers, dating from between three and seven days prior to NotPetya’s onset. But no one could find a backup for one crucial layer of the company’s network: its domain controllers, the servers that function as a detailed map of Maersk’s network and set the basic rules that determine which users are allowed access to which systems. Maersk’s 150 or so domain controllers were programmed to sync their data with one another, so that, in theory, any of them could function as a backup for all the others. But that decentralized backup strategy hadn’t accounted for one scenario: where every domain controller is wiped simultaneously. “If we can’t recover our domain controllers,” a Maersk IT staffer remembers thinking, “we can’t recover anything.” After a frantic global search, the admins finally found one lone surviving domain controller in a remote office—in Ghana. After a frantic search that entailed calling hundreds of IT admins in data centers around the world, Maersk’s desperate administrators finally found one lone surviving domain controller in a remote office—in Ghana. At some point before NotPetya struck, a blackout had knocked the Ghanaian machine offline, and the computer remained disconnected from the network. It thus contained the singular known copy of the company’s domain controller data left untouched by the malware—all thanks to a power outage. “There were a lot of joyous whoops in the office when we found it,” a Maersk administrator says. When the tense engineers in Maidenhead set up a connection to the Ghana office, however, they found its bandwidth was so thin that it would take days to transmit the several-hundred-gigabyte domain controller backup to the UK. Their next idea: put a Ghanaian staffer on the next plane to London. But none of the West African office’s employees had a British visa. So the Maidenhead operation arranged for a kind of relay race: One staffer from the Ghana office flew to Nigeria to meet another Maersk employee in the airport to hand off the very precious hard drive. That staffer then boarded the six-and-a-half-hour flight to Heathrow, carrying the keystone of Maersk’s entire recovery process. With that rescue operation completed, the Maidenhead office could begin bringing Maersk’s core services back online. After the first days, Maersk’s port operations had regained the ability to read the ships’ inventory files, so operators were no longer blind to the contents of the hulking, 18,000-container vessels arriving in their harbors. But several days would pass after the initial outage before Maersk started taking orders through Maerskline.com for new shipments, and it would be more than a week before terminals around the world started functioning with any degree of normalcy. In the meantime, Maersk staffers worked with whatever tools were still available to them. They taped paper documents to shipping containers at APM ports and took orders via personal Gmail accounts, WhatsApp, and Excel spreadsheets. “I can tell you it’s a fairly bizarre experience to find yourself booking 500 shipping containers via WhatsApp, but that’s what we did,” one Maersk customer says. About two weeks after the attack, Maersk’s network had finally reached a point where the company could begin reissuing personal computers to the majority of staff. Back at the Copenhagen headquarters, a cafeteria in the basement of the building was turned into a reinstallation assembly line. Computers were lined up 20 at a time on dining tables as help desk staff walked down the rows, inserting USB drives they’d copied by the dozens, clicking through prompts for hours. A few days after his return from Maidenhead, Henrik Jensen found his laptop in an alphabetized pile of hundreds, its hard drive wiped, a clean image of Windows installed. Everything that he and every other Maersk employee had stored locally on their machines, from notes to contacts to family photos, was gone.\\n\\nFive months after Maersk had recovered from its NotPetya attack, Maersk chair Jim Hagemann Snabe sat onstage at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, and lauded the “heroic effort” that went into the company’s IT rescue operation. From June 27, when he was first awakened by a 4 am phone call in California, ahead of a planned appearance at a Stanford conference, he said, it took just 10 days for the company to rebuild its entire network of 4,000 servers and 45,000 PCs. (Full recovery had taken far longer: Some staffers at the Maidenhead operation continued to work day and night for close to two months to rebuild Maersk’s software setup.) “We overcame the problem with human resilience,” Snabe told the crowd. Since then, Snabe went on, Maersk has worked not only to improve its cybersecurity but also to make it a “competitive advantage.” Indeed, in the wake of NotPetya, IT staffers say that practically every security feature they’ve asked for has been almost immediately approved. Multifactor authentication has been rolled out across the company, along with a long-delayed upgrade to Windows 10. Snabe, however, didn’t say much about the company’s security posture pre-NotPetya. Maersk security staffers tell WIRED that some of the corporation’s servers were, up until the attack, still running Windows 2000—an operating system so old Microsoft no longer supported it. In 2016, one group of IT executives had pushed for a preemptive security redesign of Maersk’s entire global network. They called attention to Maersk’s less-than-perfect software patching, outdated operating systems, and above all insufficient network segmentation. That last vulnerability in particular, they warned, could allow malware with access to one part of the network to spread wildly beyond its initial foothold, exactly as NotPetya would the next year. The security revamp was green-lit and budgeted. But its success was never made a so-called key performance indicator for Maersk’s most senior IT overseers, so implementing it wouldn’t contribute to their bonuses. They never carried the security makeover forward. Few firms have paid more dearly for dragging their feet on security. In his Davos talk, Snabe claimed that the company suffered only a 20 percent reduction in total shipping volume during its NotPetya outage, thanks to its quick efforts and manual workarounds. But aside from the company’s lost business and downtime, as well as the cost of rebuilding an entire network, Maersk also reimbursed many of its customers for the expense of rerouting or storing their marooned cargo. One Maersk customer described receiving a seven-figure check from the company to cover the cost of sending his cargo via last-minute chartered jet. “They paid me a cool million with no more than a two-minute discussion,” he says. On top of the panic and disruption it caused, NotPetya may have wiped away evidence of espionage or even reconnaissance for future sabotage. All told, Snabe estimated in his Davos comments, NotPetya cost Maersk between $250 million and $300 million. Most of the staffers WIRED spoke with privately suspected the company’s accountants had low-balled the figure. Regardless, those numbers only start to describe the magnitude of the damage. Logistics companies whose livelihoods depend on Maersk-owned terminals weren’t all treated as well during the outage as Maersk’s customers, for instance. Jeffrey Bader, president of a Port Newark–based trucking group, the Association of Bi-State Motor Carriers, estimates that the unreimbursed cost for trucking companies and truckers alone is in the tens of millions. “It was a nightmare,” Bader says. “We lost a lot of money, and we’re angry.” The wider cost of Maersk’s disruption to the global supply chain as a whole—which depends on just-in-time delivery of products and manufacturing components—is far harder to measure. And, of course, Maersk was only one victim. Merck, whose ability to manufacture some drugs was temporarily shut down by NotPetya, told shareholders it lost a staggering $870 million due to the malware. FedEx, whose European subsidiary TNT Express was crippled in the attack and required months to recover some data, took a $400 million blow. French construction giant Saint-Gobain lost around the same amount. Reckitt Benckiser, the British manufacturer of Durex condoms, lost $129 million, and Mondelēz, the owner of chocolate-maker Cadbury, took a $188 million hit. Untold numbers of victims without public shareholders counted their losses in secret. Only when you start to multiply Maersk’s story—imagining the same paralysis, the same serial crises, the same grueling recovery—playing out across dozens of other NotPetya victims and countless other industries does the true scale of Russia’s cyberwar crime begin to come into focus. “This was a very significant wake-up call,” Snabe said at his Davos panel. Then he added, with a Scandinavian touch of understatement, “You could say, a very expensive one.”\",\n",
       " \"Of all the cars humanity has produced in the past century, few are better loved than the Porsche 911. Elegant, accessible, a thrill to drive, and ever evolving, the car that debuted in 1964 has earned its fanatics. Which makes it jarring to hear what happened when the team at Williams Advanced Engineering stuck one in its virtual wind tunnel.\\n\\n“It was catastrophic,” says Mazen Fawaz, the CEO of Singer Vehicle Design.\\n\\nLos Angeles-based Singer specializes in restoring and occasionally rethinking various versions of the Porsche 911. Williams Advanced Engineering applies technology developed for the Williams Formula 1 team to other industries. And that catastrophe was the starting point for the companies' mildly ambitious joint venture: creating the most advanced air-cooled Porsche 911 in the world.\\n\\nWonderful as a 1990 911 may be, it’s not quite an F1 engineer’s idea of perfection. “It’s a weird thing to go to a ride and handling engineer, and he says ‘This thing is a mess’, and I say ‘Yes, isn’t it great?’” says Singer CEO Mazen Fawaz. Singer Vehicle Design\\n\\nThe project, which they called the Dynamics and Lightweighting Study, started with a stock 1990 Porsche 911. (In 1998, Porsche switched the 911’s engine to a water-cooled system, a move that still gets the purists heated.) This week, the result is making its US debut at the caviar-coated Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance, after wowing the crowds at Britain's Goodwood Festival of Speed last month.\\n\\nYou might expect an austere racing machine, stripped to the point where it has mesh instead of doors. But no: This is a beautiful, high gloss white 911 with bespoke carbon fiber seats, yellow interior trim details (Parallax White and Norfolk Yellow to the initiated), and a rear ducktail. It weighs nearly 1,000 pounds less than the 3000-pound original, and produces 500 horsepower—a twofold increase. And, according to Fawaz, it still drives like a classic 911, with all the idiosyncrasies of the rear-drive layout that owners adore. Ultimately, Singer will build just 75 cars based on the DLS study, for customers who hand over their stock car and an undisclosed, but definitely hefty, pile of money.\\n\\nIt wasn’t easy getting here. Wonderful as a 1990 911 may be, it’s not quite an F1 engineer’s idea of perfection. The folks at Williams are used to working on modern race cars, where every surface is tuned and refined, the suspension perfected, the steering inputs almost digital.\\n\\n“It’s a weird thing to go to a ride and handling engineer, and he says ‘this thing is a mess’, and I say ‘yes isn’t it great?’,” says Fawaz. “It’s like comedy, taking a vintage anything to a Formula 1 team, who make spacecraft in comparison.”\\n\\nMost of the many aerodynamic tweaks the team made are hard to spot: subtle changes to the front bumper, a totally redesigned underside, a low channel in the roof that changes airflow to improve downforce. Singer Vehicle Design\\n\\nOne of the biggest challenges was getting airflow right. The ‘catastrophic’ rating on aerodynamics came when the Williams team ran the 911’s size and dimensions through their computational fluid dynamics package, which models airflow over a vehicle. They found lift at the front as well as the back at speed—grim news for grip and safe handling. And since Fawaz (reasonably) refused to let them reshape the car, they had to get creative.\\n\\nThe customer for this first transformation had requested a ducktail spoiler (which Porsche first put on the 1972 911 2.7RS) which should have been a good start for extra downforce at the back. But when Williams plugged that into its simulations, it saw nada. “It was completely ineffective,” says Fawaz. But he didn’t want to increase the size of the wing, GT3-style. Ultimately, they found a solution: cutting a low channel in the roof, invisible from the side profile, which directs air down and over the ducktail, making it work as designed.\\n\\nMost of the many aerodynamic tweaks the team made are similarly hidden. There are subtle changes to the front bumper, but they totally redesigned the underside of the car to control airflow and improve downforce. They revised the airflow on the underside of the decklid for better cooling for the powered-up engine, which still relies on air, not water, to pull away all the excess heat it creates. At one point the team even considered exhausting air through the cool new, circular, rear lights, but that plan didn’t add anything useful. The aerodynamicists redesigned the front air cooler intake and venting, and added a front splitter, to eliminate the lift at the front too.\\n\\n“Porsche did something super weird, they built a car in the 1960s and iterated on it,” Fawaz says. “It was always a little bit humble, not the most expensive, but always could perform with the best of them.”\\n\\nAnd with Singer’s and Williams’ new updates and reimagined components, it’s now enough to convince even Formula 1 engineers of its charms.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " \"Most Saturdays, my husband Seth and I spend approximately the whole day with our phones aimed at our son, taking pictures of him from slightly different angles. There’s a diptych of him dancing in the bagel shop. There’s one of him scooting in the park. Until a few weeks ago, we'd spend our Saturday night bickering over beers about who got to post which photo to our separate Instagram accounts.\\n\\nIt’s a glamorous life.\\n\\nMutual friends who follow us both on Instagram often wound up seeing our days play out there in mirror images of each other: pictures of me and our son on Seth’s Story; photos of Seth and our son two minutes later doing the exact same activity on mine. That might feel a bit repetitive for them, but it gets weirder for everyone else. Seth’s friends who don’t know or follow me only ever see pictures of me, and my friends who don’t know or follow Seth only see pictures of him. “My friends from high school see you on Instagram all the time but probably have no idea what I look like now,” he observed a few weeks ago. This is a common problem for couples.\\n\\nNow, we have a lot of real things going on—we’re about to move across the country, so we need to find a new place to live, and a new school for our son, and all the other hard tasks that come with uprooting a life. So, naturally, instead of doing any of those things, we decided now was the right time to solve this thorny Instagram problem once and for all. And we wouldn’t stop until we landed on a perfect solution.\\n\\nMaybe we should post more selfies? No, too much vanity. Maybe we should just swap the photos we take of each other and post them to our own accounts? Too much work. Hmm. We poured some wine. That’s when we get our really good ideas. What if, Seth posited, we just had one account?\\n\\nI scrunched up my face. I worried. Wouldn’t that entail a loss of self-identity? Then again, what bearing does Instagram have on our real identity, anyway? As individuals Seth and I are very different, yet our Instagrams are always almost identical—proof in itself that these curated windows on existence are not real insight into a person’s soul. They are merely a record of our weekends.\\n\\nSo Seth and I did it. Two weeks ago, we each put a photo of our faces on our personal Instagram accounts, overlayed with the message: “Follow our new family account at [REDACTED]. This account is over.” In the caption, we explained this was an open-ended experiment and that we would no longer be checking or posting to our personal accounts. Then we uploaded a very cheesy family photo to our new account, argued one last time over the name, each logged in on our respective phones, and sat on the couch clicking to “follow” all the people we had followed separately.\\n\\nImmediately, things went wrong. Instagram flagged our account as suspicious because we were following people too quickly. After managing to add around 200 friends, we got locked out for 24 hours. This was the first indication that Instagram is not set up for this kind of shared experience. To Instagram, a couple wanting to use the service together is a bot.\\n\\nEmily Dreyfuss\\n\\nWe’d wondered whether people would actually follow the new account, and we quickly got our answer: Some would! But not necessarily the ones we expected. Instagram is weird like that—sometimes your most avid “fans,” who watch every Story and send you emoji DMs, are people you barely interact with in real life. All our superlurkers and hypercommenters followed the new account immediately. As did our college friends and former colleagues. It was our family members who hesitated—knowing us well enough, perhaps, to suspect we’d quickly tire of the experiment and close the new account, thus making a fool of them.\\n\\nWell, joke’s on you, fam. After 10 days of using our new shared account, and despite near daily vexations, we’ve decided we like it. One of my brothers finally relented and followed us. Now he can see the video of his nephew singing “London Calling” into an unplugged microphone while wearing banana pajamas. High-quality content! The other brother is not yet convinced.\\n\\nThat’s because the idea of the joint account for a couple is admittedly obnoxious. It’s social media PDA, like when people enter a new relationship and the oxytocin makes them temporarily insane so they refer to themselves as “we” all the time. It’s gross. I understand not wanting to support it! I hate when people make Instagram accounts for their babies or dogs for the same reason—it’s saccharine. But I also always follow those accounts because I love pictures of babies and dogs. (The only thing I don’t love about those accounts is when people pretend their children or pets are writing the captions. Even I have a cheese threshold.)\\n\\nIt’s kind of mortifying to me to be such a “we” on social media, but it’s also truer to our lived experience. As our very best friend put it, “The idea of it is annoying, but the reality is that it’s better!” Now she has us all in one place. Our feed approximates the experience of hanging out with us IRL all the more accurately.\\n\\nNot everyone agrees with her. An old colleague of mine, who followed the new account, told me that though he will remain a loyal follower because he’s a mensch, he finds the whole thing annoying because he’s never met Seth and therefore doesn’t care much about Seth’s perspective, which is fair.\\n\\nBut for the most part, when polled, our followers said they liked the new account, and judged it to be only mildly irritating. Hell, only mildly irritating? I’ll take it.\\n\\nEmily Dreyfuss\\n\\nThe things Seth and I find aggravating about the new account are not what I anticipated. I thought it would be confusing to DM with our friends and comment on their photos because they wouldn’t know which of us they were talking to. Turns out, they know it’s always me because Seth has never in his life commented or sent a DM. I thought it would be weird because we have such different Insta habits—I hit the heart button on basically every photo I see on Insta, and Seth never has—but it turns out that doesn’t matter at all. Sure, there are probably people he’s always followed who are surprised that our account is now liking their photos at a rapid clip, but as it turns out, I don’t care! Also, you’re welcome.\\n\\nNo, the actual annoyances of sharing an account have nothing to do with us and everything to do with Instagram and its blasted algorithm. Because Instagram is not chronological, when I scroll through our account idly waiting in line at the pharmacy, it marks those posts as seen and buries them for Seth. If he watches a Story, that story cycles to the end of our feed and I never see it. In this way, Instagram thwarts our attempt at having a joint experience.\\n\\nOther than that, though, there are real benefits. For one, we’re both looking at Instagram less. That’s partially because making the conscious decision to merge accounts made us more aware that the pressure to cultivate some kind of “personal brand” on Instagram is absurd. And it’s partially that my feed is now filled with some people who I don’t really care about, so the whole thing is a little less appealing to me.\\n\\nThe experience also expanded both of our horizons a little bit. I’m exposed to way more tattoo artists from Europe, and he’s seeing a lot more women journalists from around the world. Plus, we seem to have thoroughly confused Instagram’s ad mechanism, which is now serving me equal parts Jack Ryan movie promos along with my customary (and unwanted) bra suggestions. We’re ad disruptors!\\n\\nThe part I like the best is checking our own Story and seeing something Seth has posted. I used to always rewatch my own Stories anyway, but it was a guilty act of navel gazing. I’d live my day, upload my day, then rewatch it. Why? I don’t know. I was just compelled to. Now that same compulsion lets me find unexpected images—photos or videos of Seth’s day. It’s nice.\\n\\nAnd we’re not the only ones doing this, though it’s far from a trend. Journalist Taylor Lorenz, who covers internet culture for The Atlantic, has two shared accounts with her boyfriend. They have kept their separate accounts, and use the two joint accounts to focus on specific interests. Teenagers commonly use the platform in a similar way, she points out. They’ll sometimes share group accounts with friends to post about something they’re all into, or more commonly to have a place to debate hot-button issues.\\n\\nBrands, of course, also have joint accounts. WIRED’s Instagram has multiple administrators. A few people on Twitter told me they have family members or friends with couples or family accounts. Given that, it would be nice if Instagram would create a proper group accounts option to support our kind. Instagram declined to comment on any plans to introduce group accounts.\\n\\n“I feel like running a joint account helps relieve pressure,” Lorenz says. Like me, she’s an active liker and commenter, but in joint accounts she doesn’t worry about engaging with everyone as much. “I think overall they're a good thing,” she told me in DM. “Since you can sort of both delude yourselves into thinking the other person is doing all the mundane work of keeping up with likes, engaging with all your friends' latest content etc, so then you check it less, which leads to a better life.”\\n\\nYes, I still feel a twinge of embarrassment about sharing an account with Seth sometimes. But so far, my tiny hang-up is the only real downside to our new joint-account life. If you’re considering it and you’re sensitive to the judgment of others, you should know that when I asked on Twitter whether anyone knew people who did this, the common response was “ew” and “I assume anybody who replies to this in the affirmative gets arrested.” But you know what? Lock me up, folks, because I love love and I love our joint Instagram account.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'Following more than a year of unrelenting focus on Russian cyber attacks on Silicon Valley giants, Facebook and Twitter announced Tuesday night that they\\'ve now also thwarted a network of suspicious accounts that appear to originate in Iran.\\n\\nFirst, Facebook announced it had taken down 652 pages, groups, and accounts for \"coordinated inauthentic behavior.\" Less than an hour after Facebook went public with the news, Twitter announced in a brief series of tweets that, working with \"industry partners,\" it had shut down 284 accounts, many of which it said were from Iran.\\n\\nThe news is a reminder of the broad scope of potential adversaries targeting American tech companies. But it simultaneously signals a strengthening alliance between those companies, which have begun proactively sharing the details of their investigations with other tech giants.\\n\\nOn a call with reporters Tuesday night, Facebook executives including CEO Mark Zuckerberg described a multi-pronged investigation that unearthed several networks of bad actors. Some were associated with Russia, but others were affiliated with Iranian state media. \"These were networks of accounts that were misleading people about who they were and what they were doing,\" Zuckerberg explained. \"People need to be able to trust the connections they make on Facebook.\"\\n\\nThe company credits the cybersecurity firm FireEye with detecting one group called Liberty Front Press, which was connected with several accounts and pages. They often posed as news organizations and civil society groups, but using publicly available website registration information and IP addresses, Facebook researchers found that the group was actually affiliated with Iranian state media. All in, more than 200,000 users followed at least one of these accounts or pages across Facebook and Instagram. Facebook didn\\'t respond to WIRED\\'s request for comment about whether any of these users had been notified.\\n\\n\\'I’ve been saying for months that there’s no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.\\' Democratic senator Mark Warner\\n\\nIn its own blog post Tuesday, FireEye cautioned that identifying the origins of these groups can be difficult, due to the nature of their activities, but said they had \"moderate confidence\" in their assessment about Iranian involvement. The post included a labyrinthine illustration that maps out the different pages and their web of promotion. According to FireEye, the network promoted issues that aligned with Iranian interests. Among the striking details they discovered were \"inauthentic social media personas, masquerading as American liberals supportive of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, heavily promoting Quds Day, a holiday established by Iran in 1979 to express support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the Liberty Front Press network, Facebook found another set of accounts and pages posing as news organizations that the company says had \"links\" to the Liberty Front Press group. But this network launched more traditional attacks, attempting to hack into other Facebook users\\' accounts and spread malware. Facebook says it\\'s working with law enforcement on further investigating its findings.\\n\\nThe cyberthreat posed by Iran has been the subject of concern in intelligence circles for years. But when the US reached a deal with the country in 2015, which lifted key sanctions, Iran\\'s cyber attacks seemed to have subsided. Meanwhile, the threat Russia posed only grew in the public consciousness after the 2016 election, when Russian actors hacked into the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign chair\\'s emails, while also carrying out an influence campaign across nearly every social media platform. And yet, lawmakers have recently cautioned against taking an overly myopic view of the scope of cyber threats facing the tech sector.\\n\\nDuring a hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, just hours before Facebook\\'s announcement, Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal warned, forebodingly, \"Until there’s real action, Vladimir Putin will operate with impunity, and he will continue to use a playbook which becomes the same playbook used by other countries, notably Iran. I believe there will be news about Iranian aggression in the cyber domain.\"\\n\\nFollowing Facebook\\'s disclosure, Democratic senator Mark Warner said in a statement, “I’ve been saying for months that there’s no way the problem of social media manipulation is limited to a single troll farm in St. Petersburg, and that fact is now beyond a doubt.\"\\n\\nFacebook\\'s discovery underscores the level of vigilance required to detect threats from multiple state actors at once, even as the company tries to find and memorize the fingerprints others have left behind. In addition to the two networks associated with Liberty Front Press, the company also detected a suspicious network that shared content about Middle East politics in Arabic and Farsi, and also shared content about the United States and United Kingdom in English. These 168 pages and 140 accounts racked up 823,000 followers across Facebook and Instagram. This group also ran $6,000 worth of ads, the oldest of which ran in 2012. Despite signals indicating these accounts and pages were connected, they \"were not presenting a coordinated front in how they identified themselves,\" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook\\'s head of cybersecurity policy, said on the press call.\\n\\nFacebook noted that it also shut down additional accounts and pages associated with Russian military intelligence, but the company was light on details about what this group shared or how many Facebook users followed them. The company was also reluctant to blame Russia for another suspicious network it shut down at the end of July, saying that all of these investigations are still ongoing.\\n\\nIn his remarks to reporters, Zuckerberg continually stressed the need for tech companies and government agencies to work together to investigate and prevent these threats. His sentiment echoed Microsoft CEO Brad Smith, who earlier Tuesday also called on the government to act when he announced that Microsoft had thwarted a series of Russian cyber attacks on political groups in the United States.\\n\\n\"No one company can win this fight on its own,\" Zuckerberg said.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"Big things happen when computers get smaller. Or faster. And quantum computing is about chasing perhaps the biggest performance boost in the history of technology. The basic idea is to smash some barriers that limit the speed of existing computers by harnessing the counterintuitive physics of subatomic scales.\\n\\nIf the tech industry pulls off that, ahem, quantum leap, you won’t be getting a quantum computer for your pocket. Don’t start saving for an iPhone Q. We could, however, see significant improvements in many areas of science and technology, such as longer-lasting batteries for electric cars or advances in chemistry that reshape industries or enable new medical treatments. Quantum computers won’t be able to do everything faster than conventional computers, but on some tricky problems they have advantages that would enable astounding progress.\\n\\nIt’s not productive (or polite) to ask people working on quantum computing when exactly those dreamy applications will become real. The only thing for sure is that they are still many years away. Prototype quantum computing hardware is still embryonic. But powerful—and, for tech companies, profit-increasing—computers powered by quantum physics have recently started to feel less hypothetical.\\n\\nThe cooling and support structure for one of IBM's quantum computing chips (the tiny black square at the bottom of the image). Amy Lombard\\n\\nThat’s because Google, IBM, and others have decided it’s time to invest heavily in the technology, which, in turn, has helped quantum computing earn a bullet point on the corporate strategy PowerPoint slides of big companies in areas such as finance, like JPMorgan, and aerospace, like Airbus. In 2017, venture investors plowed $241 million into startups working on quantum computing hardware or software worldwide, according to CB Insights. That’s triple the amount in the previous year.\\n\\nLike the befuddling math underpinning quantum computing, some of the expectations building around this still-impractical technology can make you lightheaded. If you squint out the window of a flight into SFO right now, you can see a haze of quantum hype drifting over Silicon Valley. But the enormous potential of quantum computing is undeniable, and the hardware needed to harness it is advancing fast. If there were ever a perfect time to bend your brain around quantum computing, it’s now. Say “Schrodinger’s superposition” three times fast, and we can dive in.\\n\\nThe History of Quantum Computing Explained\\n\\nThe prehistory of quantum computing begins early in the 20th century, when physicists began to sense they had lost their grip on reality.\\n\\nFirst, accepted explanations of the subatomic world turned out to be incomplete. Electrons and other particles didn’t just neatly carom around like Newtonian billiard balls, for example. Sometimes they acted like waves instead. Quantum mechanics emerged to explain such quirks, but introduced troubling questions of its own. To take just one brow-wrinkling example, this new math implied that physical properties of the subatomic world, like the position of an electron, didn’t really exist until they were observed.\\n\\nIf you find that baffling, you’re in good company. A year before winning a Nobel for his contributions to quantum theory, Caltech’s Richard Feynman remarked that “nobody understands quantum mechanics.” The way we experience the world just isn’t compatible. But some people grasped it well enough to redefine our understanding of the universe. And in the 1980s a few of them—including Feynman—began to wonder if quantum phenomena like subatomic particles' “don’t look and I don’t exist” trick could be used to process information. The basic theory or blueprint for quantum computers that took shape in the 80s and 90s still guides Google and others working on the technology.\\n\\nBefore we belly flop into the murky shallows of quantum computing 0.101, we should refresh our understanding of regular old computers. As you know, smartwatches, iPhones, and the world’s fastest supercomputer all basically do the same thing: they perform calculations by encoding information as digital bits, aka 0s and 1s. A computer might flip the voltage in a circuit on and off to represent 1s and 0s for example.\\n\\nQuantum computers do calculations using bits, too. After all, we want them to plug into our existing data and computers. But quantum bits, or qubits, have unique and powerful properties that allow a group of them to do much more than an equivalent number of conventional bits.\\n\\nQubits can be built in various ways, but they all represent digital 0s and 1s using the quantum properties of something that can be controlled electronically. Popular examples—at least among a very select slice of humanity—include superconducting circuits, or individual atoms levitated inside electromagnetic fields. The magic power of quantum computing is that this arrangement lets qubits do more than just flip between 0 and 1. Treat them right and they can flip into a mysterious extra mode called a superposition.\\n\\nThe looped cables connect the chip at the bottom of the structure to its control system. Amy Lombard\\n\\nYou may have heard that a qubit in superposition is both 0 and 1 at the same time. That’s not quite true and also not quite false—there’s just no equivalent in Homo sapiens’ humdrum classical reality. If you have a yearning to truly grok it, you must make a mathematical odyssey WIRED cannot equip you for. But in the simplified and dare we say perfect world of this explainer, the important thing to know is that the math of a superposition describes the probability of discovering either a 0 or 1 when a qubit is read out—an operation that crashes it out of a quantum superposition into classical reality. A quantum computer can use a collection of qubits in superpositions to play with different possible paths through a calculation. If done correctly, the pointers to incorrect paths cancel out, leaving the correct answer when the qubits are read out as 0s and 1s.\\n\\nJargon for the Quantum Qurious What's a qubit? A device that uses quantum mechanical effects to represent 0s and 1s of digital data, similar to the bits in a conventional computer. What's a superposition? It's the trick that makes quantum computers tick, and makes qubits more powerful than ordinary bits. A superposition is in an intuition-defying mathematical combination of both 0 and 1. Quantum algorithms can use a group of qubits in a superposition to shortcut through calculations. What's quantum entanglement? A quantum effect so unintuitive that Einstein dubbed it “spooky action at a distance.” When two qubits in a superposition are entangled, certain operations on one have instant effects on the other, a process that helps quantum algorithms be more powerful than conventional ones. What's quantum speedup? The holy grail of quantum computing—a measure of how much faster a quantum computer could crack a problem than a conventional computer could. Quantum computers aren’t well-suited to all kinds of problems, but for some they offer an exponential speedup, meaning their advantage over a conventional computer grows explosively with the size of the input problem.\\n\\nFor some problems that are very time consuming for conventional computers, this allows a quantum computer to find a solution in far fewer steps than a conventional computer would need. Grover’s algorithm, a famous quantum search algorithm, could find you in a phone book with 100 million names with just 10,000 operations. A classical search algorithm would require 50 million operations, on average, to spool through all the listings and find you. For Grover’s and some other quantum algorithms, the bigger the initial problem—or phonebook—the further behind a conventional computer is left in the digital dust.\\n\\nThe reason we don’t have useful quantum computers today is that qubits are extremely finicky. The quantum effects they must control are very delicate, and stray heat or noise can flip 0s and 1s, or wipe out a crucial superposition. Qubits have to be carefully shielded, and operated at very cold temperatures, sometimes only fractions of a degree above absolute zero. Most plans for quantum computing depend on using a sizable chunk of a quantum processor’s power to correct its own errors, caused by misfiring qubits.\\n\\nRecent excitement about quantum computing stems from progress in making qubits less flaky. That’s giving researchers the confidence to start bundling the devices into larger groups. Startup Rigetti Computing recently announced it has built a processor with 128 qubits made with aluminum circuits that are super-cooled to make them superconducting. Google and IBM have announced their own chips with 72 and 50 qubits, respectively. That’s still far fewer than would be needed to do useful work with a quantum computer—it would probably require at least thousands—but as recently as 2016 those companies’ best chips had qubits only in the single digits. After tantalizing computer scientists for 30 years, practical quantum computing may not exactly be close, but it has begun to feel a lot closer.\\n\\nWhat the Future Holds for Quantum Computing\\n\\nSome large companies and governments have started treating quantum computing research like a race—perhaps fittingly it’s one where both the distance to the finish line and the prize for getting there are unknown.\\n\\nGoogle, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft have all expanded their teams working on the technology, with a growing swarm of startups such as Rigetti in hot pursuit. China and the European Union have each launched new programs measured in the billions of dollars to stimulate quantum R&D. And in the US, the Trump White House has created a new committee to coordinate government work on quantum information science. Several bills were introduced to Congress in 2018 proposing new funding for quantum research, totalling upwards of $1.3 billion. It’s not quite clear what the first killer apps of quantum computing will be, or when they will appear. But there’s a sense that whoever is first make these machines useful will gain big economic and national security advantages.\\n\\nCopper structures conduct heat well and connect the apparatus to its cooling system. Amy Lombard\\n\\nBack in the world of right now, though, quantum processors are too simple to do practical work. Google is working to stage a demonstration known as quantum supremacy, in which a quantum processor would solve a carefully designed math problem beyond existing supercomputers. But that would be an historic scientific milestone, not proof quantum computing is ready to do real work.\\n\\nAs quantum computer prototypes get larger, the first practical use for them will probably be for chemistry simulations. Computer models of molecules and atoms are vital to the hunt for new drugs or materials. Yet conventional computers can’t accurately simulate the behavior of atoms and electrons during chemical reactions. Why? Because that behavior is driven by quantum mechanics, the full complexity of which is too great for conventional machines. Daimler and Volkswagen have both started investigating quantum computing as a way to improve battery chemistry for electric vehicles. Microsoft says other uses could include designing new catalysts to make industrial processes less energy intensive, or even to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to mitigate climate change.\\n\\nQuantum computers would also be a natural fit for code-breaking. We’ve known since the 90s that they could zip through the math underpinning the encryption that secures online banking, flirting, and shopping. Quantum processors would need to be much more advanced to do this, but governments and companies are taking the threat seriously. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of evaluating new encryption systems that could be rolled out to quantum-proof the internet.\\n\\nWhen cooled to operating temperature, the whole assembly is hidden inside this white insulated casing. Amy Lombard\\n\\nTech companies such as Google are also betting that quantum computers can make artificial intelligence more powerful. That’s further in the future and less well mapped out than chemistry or code-breaking applications, but researchers argue they can figure out the details down the line as they play around with larger and larger quantum processors. One hope is that quantum computers could help machine-learning algorithms pick up complex tasks using many fewer than the millions of examples typically used to train AI systems today.\\n\\nDespite all the superposition-like uncertainty about when the quantum computing era will really begin, big tech companies argue that programmers need to get ready now. Google, IBM, and Microsoft have all released open source tools to help coders familiarize themselves with writing programs for quantum hardware. IBM has even begun to offer online access to some of its quantum processors, so anyone can experiment with them. Long term, the big computing companies see themselves making money by charging corporations to access data centers packed with supercooled quantum processors.\\n\\nWhat’s in it for the rest of us? Despite some definite drawbacks, the age of conventional computers has helped make life safer, richer, and more convenient—many of us are never more than five seconds away from a kitten video. The era of quantum computers should have similarly broad reaching, beneficial, and impossible to predict consequences. Bring on the qubits.\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nThis guide was last updated on August 21, 2018.\\n\\nEnjoyed this deep dive? Check out more WIRED Guides.\",\n",
       " \"On December 13, 2011, Paul Allen, the reclusive billionaire and cofounder of Microsoft, stood in front of a group of reporters in Seattle and told them about his wild new plan. Wearing the tech-Brahmin uniform of navy blazer, dress shirt, and conspicuously absent tie, Allen made some introductory remarks and then rolled a video simulation of a strange beast of an aircraft leaving an oversize hangar. This was Strato\\xadlaunch. It would be the largest airplane, by wingspan, ever created. The twin-fuselage, catamaran-style aircraft would be a flying launchpad, its purpose to heave a half-million-pound rocket ship to cruising altitude and then drop it, whereupon the rocket would ignite its engines for a fiery ascent into space. Allen’s hope was that this extraordinary bird would be able to do quick laps between the ground and the stratosphere, making access to space no more exotic than a New York–to–Boston commuter flight. Burt Rutan took the microphone next. Rutan, a gregarious designer of exotic aircraft, wore a light-blue work shirt and sported huge Elvis-style muttonchops. He was the original architect of the outlandish endeavor and the person who had sold Allen on the project. “Right here in front of us is a very large mistake,” he said, landing heavily on the word mistake and jabbing his finger at a model of the plane. The problem, he explained, was that no one in the room could possibly grasp how friggin’ big Stratolaunch would be. For them to have any sense, they’d have to understand that even a Boeing 747 would seem like a Tinkertoy in comparison. Rutan’s devilish grin said it all: This would be a plane to defy the imagination. The plane, he and Allen said, would take its first flight in 2015. Three years past that target date, the plane finally exists, and as Rutan promised, it is one big mama. As I discovered, nothing—not even a Rutan-approved scale model—can prepare you for an encounter with it. This past December I traveled to the Mojave Air and Space Port, a desert city of giant industrial structures in Southern California, where Stratolaunch was built. The plane’s facility on the eastern edge of the port stands out among the other structures. After walking through some drab offices, I was escorted into the approximately 100,000-square-foot hangar. The gleaming white Stratolaunch didn’t just fill the expanse; it reached into every corner of it. There was no way to take in the monster with a single glance. Starting near its tail, I walked through and around it, craning my neck and stretching on my tiptoes to gather mental snapshots of the two fuselages and the white drag strip of a wing and stitch them together into one panoramic picture. Related Stories Welcome to Spaceport America. Your Rocket Will Depart Soon. Ish.\\n\\nWhy Phoenix's Airplanes Can't Take Off in Extreme Heat\\n\\nThe Age of Electric Aviation Is Just 30 Years Away Everything about Stratolaunch is supersized. It has six screaming Pratt & Whitney turbofan jet engines, salvaged from three 747s. Its maximum takeoff weight is 1.3 million pounds. It’s got more than 80 miles of wiring. Most astounding is its 385-foot wingspan, the spec that puts Stratolaunch in the history books. That number may not seem remarkable, but on a single airplane wing 385 feet is an eternity. It’s a football field plus the end zones and a little bit more. If the Wright brothers had begun their initial Kitty Hawk flight at the tip of one Stratolaunch wing, they could have completed the journey and done it twice more before they reached the other end. Though the two fuselages look identical, only the right one has a cockpit, largely preserved from one of the 747s, with a throttle, foot pedal, and even some analog displays that a commercial pilot working in the 1970s might find familiar. One of the seats is covered by a sheepskin-like cushion of the type often found in New York City taxis. Looking out the window, the second fuselage is so far away that it looks like a plane sitting on an adjacent runway. It’s hard to imagine this mammoth structure rising into the air. But the team—without Rutan, who retired in 2011—has been methodically taking it through a series of tests: bearing its own weight, firing its engines, taxiing down 2-plus miles of runway. Allen promises Stratolaunch will ascend as early as this fall. Thousands of people will turn their eyes to Mojave when that first flight happens. But after that, what? The original plan was to create a more reliable and flexible way to shoot satellites into space. But while Stratolaunch’s development has dragged on, the private space industry has leaped ahead. Other billionaires, notably Elon Musk, have dazzled the world with fiery launches and wild achievements such as reusable rockets and orbiting sports cars. The industry is becoming increasingly competitive, and numerous companies are scheming to lower the cost and increase the reliability of rocket launches. Musk’s SpaceX was going to supply Allen with the rockets Strato\\xadlaunch would carry, but it ditched the project years ago. The mammoth aircraft inevitably brings to mind the Spruce Goose, the much-mocked giant airplane and pet project of tycoon Howard Hughes. Allen had visited the legendary plane in its home in an Oregon museum. That plane (it was actually made mostly of birch, not spruce) was intended to send supplies and soldiers to combat during World War II, but it flew only once, for just a mile, long after the conflict was over. Stratolaunch, too, could be obsolete before its massive wing ever reaches the sky. Is biggest better? Maybe. Maybe not. But have you seen this thing? Paul Allen, the billionaire funding Strato\\xadlaunch, has been fascinated with space travel since childhood. “When you see that giant plane, it’s a little nutty,” he says. But his goal is more practical: competing in the private space business. Joe Pugliese\\n\\nAs a teenager, Paul Allen was a sci-fi and rocketry nerd. He dreamed of becoming an astronaut, but that ambition was scuttled by nearsighted\\xadness. His childhood bedroom was filled with science fiction and space books. Bill Gates remembers Allen’s obsession. “Even when I first met him—he was in tenth grade and I was in eighth—he had read way more science fiction than anyone else,” says Gates, who later founded Microsoft with Allen. “Way more.” One of Allen’s favorites was a popular science classic called Rockets, Missiles, and Space Travel, by Willy Ley, first published in 1944. As Allen tells it in his memoir, he was crushed when he visited his parents as an adult and went to his old room to reference a book. He discovered that his mother had sold his collection. (The sale price: $75.) Using a blowup of an old photo of the room, Allen dispatched scouts to painstakingly re-create his boyhood library. Allen never stopped thinking about space. In April 1981, during crunch time for Microsoft’s most important project—developing an operating system for the upcoming IBM personal computer—Allen up and left, joining a colleague on a field trip to Florida to see the first space shuttle launch. (Gates, for the record, still seems a bit annoyed about that.) “It was unbelievably impressive,” Allen says now of that launch. But he never seriously imagined getting involved in rocketry, until he met Burt Rutan. Rutan had been hooked on airplanes since he was 8 years old. He started gaining recognition in the 1970s, selling plans for small aircraft that intrepid enthusiasts could build for themselves. His designs reimagined what a plane could be, changing up the placement of fins, wings, and even cockpits. In 1982 he started his company, Scaled Composites, in the California desert. He built planes that looked like praying mantises and others that had the whimsy of a Playmobil toy. (Five of his creations are now on display in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.) The company changed ownership several times over the years, until Northrop Grumman acquired it a decade ago. As Scaled Composites churned out cunning, award-winning designs, it became the aviation equivalent of Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory, staffed by stubborn outcasts who had been lured by the charisma of their iconoclast boss. “It was the dream job,” says Matt Stinemetze, Scaled’s chief engineer, who joined in his early twenties. “Burt was this legendary designer who designed all these home-builds that were weird and backward. It was almost like we always made these very different things because we could.” By 1996, Allen, who had long since left Microsoft and was pursuing an eclectic range of investments (including snapping up the Portland Trail Blazers), had begun exploring the idea of delivering broadband from the sky. He heard about a Rutan creation he thought might be useful for this enterprise, and he flew to Mojave in his personal Boeing 757 to ask about it face-to-face. Nothing came of the conversation that day—except that Rutan learned Allen was a “space nut” with money to spend. It was a fateful connection. A few years later, when Rutan was contemplating building the first private rocket that could send a human into space, he made a pilgrimage to Seattle to visit Allen. One aspect of his plan, he said, was to launch a manned spaceship from an airplane, not a launch pad. Rutan thought he could do it with less than $20 million. Allen saw in Rutan’s idea an opportunity to open up space the same way he and Bill Gates had popularized computers. He agreed to fund the spaceship, and they closed the deal with a handshake. They also decided to enter the competition for the Ansari XPrize, which offered $10 million to the first team to send a person into suborbital space twice in two weeks using the same equipment. Rutan called that effort SpaceShipOne. Richard Branson, another billionaire fascinated by space, and who knew Rutan, caught wind of it and raced to the Mojave. He chipped in $1 million in exchange for branding the rocket ship with the Virgin logo. Branson’s ultimate interest was space tourism—high-priced, suborbital thrill rides—and he felt that SpaceShipOnecould give him a high-profile start. On September 29, 2004, a SpaceShipOne test pilot barely, but triumphantly, crossed the 62-mile border between Earth’s atmosphere and space. Five days later, another pilot repeated the trick. Rutan and Allen won the XPrize. Allen’s excitement at the achievement was dampened by his increasing anxiety. The first few SpaceShipOne sorties were tense affairs, with unplanned spins and even a near-crash landing. The space shuttle Columbia’s fatal 2003 reentry into Earth’s atmosphere, which killed seven astronauts, was still fresh, and he was haunted by the prospect that they might lose one of the pilots. As Allen later wrote, when the rockets fired during the prize-winning SpaceShipOne flight, Branson asked him, “Isn’t this better than the best sex you’ve ever had?” Allen thought otherwise. “If I was this anxious during any kind of interpersonal activity, I couldn’t enjoy it very much,” he told himself. Branson wanted to license the SpaceShipOne technology from Allen for space tourism, and Allen agreed. Branson’s effort to develop Virgin Galactic ended up marred by two fatal accidents, the exact scenario that had frightened Allen. (Virgin Galactic is still planning to send customers for a 90-minute whirl.) Allen was out of the space race. He turned his focus to his new institute on the human brain, a real estate push in his native Seattle, and a different kind of ship: his roughly 414-foot yacht, known as the Octopus. Burt Rutan, a designer of exotic aircraft, spent two decades developing what he called the Big Airplane. He retired in 2011, and Stratolaunch does not include some of his more out-there ideas. “Burt is not the designer of the airplane in Mojave now,” he says. Joe Pugliese\\n\\nRutan, meanwhile, was thinking about the Brobdingnagian airplane that would eventually become Stratolaunch. In 1992 he had been summoned by Antonio Elias, a senior executive at a commercial space company called Orbital Sciences Corporation, to meet with a small group. Elias was exploring the idea of building a heavy spacecraft that could be launched from a giant airplane. One problem with ground-based rockets is that they can take off from only a small number of facilities, like the Kennedy Space Center or Vandenberg Air Force Base, where competition for launch time creates long delays. A plane-based launch would create new possibilities. But a plane that big had other challenges. Rutan’s analysis concluded that to deliver the weight of the rocket Elias was talking about—up to 640,000 pounds—you’d need a wingspan of almost 400 feet. That wing had to be strong too. In addition to two fuselages and tons of fuel, it would be carrying a set of jet engines and that massive vehicle. Rutan planned to build the plane from nonmetal composites, rather than aluminum, to keep the weight down, but making the composite strong enough presented another problem. Rutan solved this dilemma in part with a process called pultrusion, in which a machine pulls a material at a constant rate and then bakes it until it hardens, a way to mold huge segments of the plane with a consistent strength. This technique let the engineers manufacture the very long spars that fortify the giant wing. Rutan began working on a design, even as he realized that the odds were against it ever being built. Using traditional construction methods and materials, the price tag might stretch past a billion, perhaps even reaching the cost of a nuclear aircraft carrier. He figured he could build it more cheaply, especially if he took his scavenger mentality to the limit. “I reasoned that if I could lift out engines, pylons, landing gear, actuators, electricals, and cockpit stuff from 747s, it was doable for us,” he says. Over the next 20 years, Rutan worked with three prospective customers as he continued designing what he referred to as the Big Airplane. He won’t say who the customers were, but none of them took the step of commissioning it. Then Allen decided to get back in the space business. When I first talked to Allen, he was vague about why he decided to fund Stratolaunch. “I did my thing, we won the prize,” he says, speaking by video conference from Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the former home of Georgia O’Keeffe. It’s one of at least seven properties he owns. He’s seated with his legs stretched out on a deep couch, almost swallowed up by giant patterned seat cushions. I’m talking to him from Seattle, and I’m not sure if his lack of eye contact with me is a result of shyness or because my screen image isn’t aligned with the camera. “Burt Rutan planted a seed that he wanted to do something orbital with a scaled-up plane,” he finally says. Allen later said he had another reason: He’d been watching as NASA pulled back on space operations and private businesses emerged to fill the gaps. The terrain was becoming irresistible, and he figured this was his opportunity. Let Richard Branson offer suborbital thrill rides to civilians. Let Elon Musk go to Mars. Allen suspected there was another business proposition. The cost of building satellites was dropping as computers, cameras, and sensors became cheaper and more powerful. Their uses were growing too. They could be used to detect illegal ocean fishing—another Allen-funded project—or monitor humanitarian crises. If there were a reliable and thrifty way to launch satellites, people might come up with more uses, creating an even bigger market. That’s what happened with PCs. Allen thought air launches could hasten that process. They are not as sensitive to weather as those held at traditional vertical launch facilities, allowing for more flexible takeoffs. They could also be more affordable, as the airplane can be reused many times. But no one had ever built an air-launch system capable of heaving super-heavy payloads into orbit. Allen incorporated the Stratolaunch company and set about building the huge hangar for the plane in Mojave, next to Scaled Composites. (The plane’s original codename was Maliboo, but the Scaled Composites people called it Roc, after the giant bird of prey in Middle Eastern mythology. Rutan jokes that it’s really an acronym for Rutan’s on Crack.) Allen was still queasy about putting lives in peril, but this time he had a rationale. “There’s a distinction between taking someone’s ticket for a joyride in space and having a commercial test pilot who knows the risk,” Allen says. Even so, he admits that it takes fortitude to send any human into the great void. “It’s different than having a bug in Microsoft Word or something,” he adds. “You have to be comfortable that something bad might happen—it’s a whole other level of anxiety.” Though retired, Rutan still sits on the Strato\\xadlaunch board. He makes a point to credit the designers at Scaled Composites, albeit in his own fashion: “Burt Rutan designed different configurations for the Big Airplane for over 20 years,” he says, referring to himself in the third person. “But Burt is not the designer of the airplane in Mojave now.” That’s kind of a shame because, as Rutan describes it, his original vision for Stratolaunch was even more radical than the plane now in a hangar in the Mojave spaceport. He had situated the cockpit toward the tail, attached to a massive foil connecting the dual fuselages. The pilot’s placement at the back of the aircraft would offer a view of the rest of the vehicle, making it easier to control. Stratolaunch’s current CEO, Jean Floyd, explains that the designers determined that the rear cockpit and its foil put too much weight at the back of the plane, so they switched early on to a design where the two fuselages would be connected only by the main wing. The team worked to speed up construction by using off-the-shelf parts whenever possible, the most conspicuous example being the repurposing of three 747s. But the surface of the plane had to be created from scratch. “This vehicle has some of the largest composite components ever built in the world, made by hand by fabricators, all made by our guys,” says Jacob Leichtweisz\\xad-Fortier, who works on the plane. The most massive pieces were 285-foot spars that give the wing its resiliency, each one weighing 18,000 pounds. The team first constructed the wing out of the gargantuan spars and built the rest of the plane around it. The plane’s extreme size led to some unexpected complications: The scaffolding needed to assemble the wing had to be about 40 feet high. “It starts to look like a building,” Stinemetze says. “In fact, the way California treats it, it is a building. It has to meet codes for sprinklers and electrical power.” When the plane was ready to emerge from its scaffolding and get towed out of the hangar, just lowering it 2 feet to the ground took eight hours, Floyd says. While the plane was taking shape, Stratolaunch was struggling to find rockets to launch. For a few years, Allen’s company searched for a replacement for SpaceX and finally settled on the Pegasus XL rocket, built by Orbital ATK. (Orbital is also owned by Northrop Grumman.) But the choice of rocket was anticlimactic. More than 40 Pegasus rockets have already launched from the air, usually from a converted Lockheed L011 Tristar, a commercial airliner that is almost completely retired. It calls into question the whole Stratolaunch enterprise. Why build the world’s biggest aircraft just to launch a rocket with a small payload that can be shot off from a creaky out-of-service plane? For Stratolaunch to fulfill its promise, Allen realized, he would have to build his own rockets. In 2016, Stratolaunch began that process. “At first we looked at using off-the-shelf engines, even rebuilding surplus space shuttle engines,” Allen says. But then the company’s engineers realized that new technologies, especially 3-D printing, would be more efficient. “You can just print these engines almost from scratch for so much less,” Allen says, estimating that a new engine can be printed for about a fifth of the cost of repurposing space shuttle overstock. Strato\\xadlaunch formed a team of rocket designers, led by SpaceX’s former head of propulsion, Jeff Thornburg. The company will test its engines at a NASA facility in Stennis, Mississippi. Sharing their road map publicly for the first time, Thornburg and Floyd laid out their plans for Stratolaunch: Its first custom rocket ship will be considerably bigger than the Pegasus, able to transport multiple satellites or other payloads. This medium-size rocket is nicknamed Kraken, after the legendary Icelandic sea monster. Floyd says customers will be able to use it to get satellites into low Earth orbit for less than $30 million, a competitive price and about half of what SpaceX charges for a launch of its Falcon 9 rocket. Floyd estimates that Kraken will be operational in 2022.\\n\\nThe next steps are more ambitious. In a project codenamed Black Ice, Stratolaunch is designing reusable space planes that will take off from the big airplane and go into orbit. The first one will be programmed to open its bay doors once in orbit and release its payload, perhaps even a fleet of satellites, into space. And then it will return to Earth. The idea is not all that different from the original space shuttle, which was a reusable vehicle that could also steer itself down from orbit to land on a runway. It can “come back and land at Mojave where the plane is waiting, the fuel system is waiting,” Floyd says. “You roll up underneath the plane, you refuel, you put the next payload in, and you go again.” Finally, Stratolaunch aims to build a second version of Black Ice that can carry astronauts. That ship won’t be flying for at least a decade. But by then, who knows what Stratolaunch’s competitors will be up to? Though Allen reportedly plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on his space enterprise, and is its sole investor, billions are being plowed into companies such as Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, both of which are trying to cut costs in the private space industry with reusable booster rockets that take off from the ground, not air launches. The companies have deals with NASA and commercial customers worth billions of dollars. Traditional defense contractors are also developing their own orbital rockets. And a new generation of people are thinking up new approaches to space. Earlier this year came news that a startup called SpinLaunch was developing a system in which a catapult-like contraption could efficiently zip satellites into orbit, aiming to cut prices to less than $500,000 per launch. Investors include Airbus Ventures and Kleiner Perkins. Stratolaunch is not commenting on whether it has any customers signed up. Floyd suggests the business part of Stratolaunch is a work in progress. “They love this,” he says, “but this has to fly first.” In other words, get the thing in the air, then they’ll talk. Rutan explains his design for an amphi\\xadbious plane. Joe Pugliese Rutan keeps models of many of his aircraft, including the Boomerang, pictured with his role model: Elvis Presley. (“Music died when Elvis died,” he says.) Joe Pugliese\",\n",
       " 'A big thing happened this weekend. Crazy Rich Asians hit theaters and brought in an impressive $34 million over its five-day weekend. (It technically opened Wednesday night.) That may not qualify as \"crazy rich\" in the era of $100 million-plus Star Wars opening weekends, but for context, it\\'s the best-performing comedy since last year’s Girls Trip—which went on to earn over $115 million domestically. Crazy Rich Asians has the power, and buzz, to do even better based on this weekend’s turnout.\\n\\nBut beyond being a big hit, it’s also a big deal. It’s been 25 years since The Joy Luck Club—the last movie with an all-Asian cast to get a wide release—hit theaters, and that’s, frankly, far too long. Like, a quarter of a century too long. But now director Jon M. Chu’s movie, which is full of shining performances by Constance Wu (Fresh Off the Boat), Awkwafina (Ocean’s 8), Michelle Yeoh (Star Trek: Discovery), Gemma Chan (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them), and newcomer Henry Golding, is here, and it’s on track to be the event movie of the summer.\\n\\nAll of which is to say, we gathered a handful of writers and editors—Pia Ceres, Phuc Pham, Brian Raftery, and Angela Watercutter—to hash out their various feelings about Crazy Rich Asians. Read on.\\n\\nAngela Watercutter: I want to start with a question for everybody: What was your experience in the theater watching Crazy Rich Asians? I went on opening night, and some of the film’s cast—Awkwafina, Ken Jeong, and Jimmy O. Yang among them—came out to surprise (and throw concessions at) the audience at the theater I went to, but even before they showed up everyone seemed amped to be there. And the energy only continued once the movie began. Folks were clapping, gasping, crying. Was it the same for you all?\\n\\nPia Ceres: I think there was a bit of trepidation when I walked into the theater. Sitting in a majority Asian American audience, I picked up on collective excitement mingled with worry, like Will this be good? Will this represent us well? But once Jeong landed a perfect joke about Asian accents, the theater erupted with laughter—and I let my guard down.\\n\\nThe gravity of Crazy Rich Asians didn’t fully hit me, though, until I was walking out of the theater. A white man remarked, not unkindly, “Well, that was just another rom-com.” I felt the urge to flail my popcorn bucket in protest: It wasn\\'t just any rom-com to me! But maybe both of us were right. Maybe it speaks to the movie’s historic achievement that these impressions can coexist.\\n\\nTake, for example, that searing mah-jongg showdown. My grandma taught me how to play when I was a kid, but I’ve totally forgotten (sorry Grandma!). So I was acutely aware of the moments when a character flipped a tile onscreen and other moviegoers gasped. They “got it” just a split second before I did. And I think those disparate perceptions—the gap between what a tile flip means to one viewer or another, a gap that doesn’t compromise one’s appreciation of the scene—makes Crazy Rich Asians such an incredible movie.\\n\\nYou can (and should!) enjoy it as a blithe love story. I rooted for Wu’s heroine, whose pluck brings to mind a modern-day Lizzie Bennet. I swooned for Golding’s abs. I bawled when Kina Grannis lent her soulful voice to a wedding scene. It is so much fun to watch.\\n\\nAnd yet. CRA will mean something different for people who are, perhaps for the first time in a Hollywood blockbuster, seeing their music, their foods, their accents represented in a way that feels genuine and normal. I felt that long-awaited flash of recognition in the protagonist’s relationship with her immigrant mother. It’s not reductive to call Crazy Rich Asians a lush, delightful rom-com; but if you’ve had a certain set of cultural experiences, it’s also so much more.\\n\\nAs far as Asian representation goes, it’s obviously narrow in scope (you can glean as much from the title). It does, though, give me a tremendous amount of hope: that everyone in the cast will become super-mega-famous. That this “first” will open the door to “more.” And that future moviegoers won’t have to wait as long as I had to, to see a movie like this.\\n\\nPhuc Pham: I got to my screening pretty close to showtime, and I was surprised to see how many seats were already taken up. I had been tracking this movie ever since the book got optioned, but that was when it really hit me that CRA could be big.\\n\\nLike Pia, I’m hopeful that CRA’s success will lead to more robust roles for Asians. But to echo our colleague Jason Parham, if this is the tentpole for Asian American films going forward, I’m worried that America will get used to the representation of Asians as well-to-do—something that feels dangerously close to the myth that Asian Amerians are the model minority. The common refrain I hear from friends who supported this movie and are tuned into Asian American politics is that these are just baby steps.\\n\\nWatercutter: Totally. Hopefully this film will open the door for a variety of new stories from Asian filmmakers and actors—all of them different from the one told in Crazy Rich Asians. (Hear that, Hollywood?)\\n\\nBrian Raftery: Of the many milestones achieved by Crazy Rich Asians, it’s worth noting that this weekend marked the first time in a while that millions of people showed up in theaters to see a romantic-comedy-drama (and with its mother-girlfriend showdown and adultery subplot, CRA, to me, definitely feels more rom-com-dram than strictly rom-com). It’s a genre the studios have largely abandoned in the past few years, as mid-budget love stories no longer make quite as much financial sense as they did in the B.C. (Before Capes) era. In the late ’90s, there were still plenty of grown-up relationship tales, like The Best Man and Jerry Maguire. But they’ve all but disappeared from theaters in the last few years, having migrated to Netflix or the Hallmark Channel. So it was kind of a kick to watch a colorful, lovestruck adult drama, while surrounded by other semi-adults such as myself.\\n\\nAlso, CRA plays beautifully on the big screen: Director Jon M. Chu has a wildly varied filmography, one that includes everything from a G.I. Joe sequel to a pair of Step Up movies to a Justin Bieber 3-D concert documentary. His movies are often in motion, and there’s a vibrant, fast-moving, yet unshowy energy to CRA, which moves briskly from one ornate setting to the next (though none of the film’s visuals can match the majesty that is Ken Jeong’s Versace bomber jacket, which looks like it was flown in from Sgt. Pepper’s residency in Las Vegas). And the Mahjong duel at the end of the film is one of the most impressively staged scenes of any movie this year: a tense battle of wills that’s no less dramatic if you don’t know the rules of the game.\\n\\nBut the precision and flair with which CRA is directed only serves to highlight what, to my mind, is the film’s biggest detriment: a script that throws together way too many subplots, feels oddly uncurious about its characters—is there anything to know about Nick, other than he’s, you know, pretty nice?—and is overloaded with exposition. Granted, CRA is partly pure big-screen fantasy, which is A-OK with a softie like me. (Did I get teary during that first-class proposal scene? MAYBE.) But at times I longed for conversations between the characters that didn’t involve them reiterating the past few years of their lives for the audience. I wanted more scenes along the lines of the dumpling tutorial, or even the food-stand binge: relaxed, revealing, and a lot less hand-holdy.\\n\\nWatercutter: Side note: Anyone remember when Chu and his Step Up 2 crew got into a YouTube dance battle with Miley Cyrus?\\n\\nCeres: What, how did I miss this?! Adding to the YouTube queue, stat.\\n\\nWatercutter: It ended with a battle at the Teen Choice Awards, but before that everyone from Lindsay Lohan to Adam Sandler got involved. Anyway, sorry to distract. Carry on.\\n\\nCeres: I agree with Brian’s point on extraneous subplots. That had bothered me about the book, and the movie adaptation seemed like a missed opportunity to prune some exposition in favor of fully realizing its characters. One secondary character’s arc, in particular, had so much potential to complicate this extravagant world, but the film moves at such a clip that we couldn’t fully appreciate it.\\n\\nPham: Brian, that proposal scene was top-notch, but I think it happened while they were still in budget economy, no? (Sorry, I had to.)\\n\\nAlso, I have to admit that I initially wasn’t planning to see this in the theater. Despite being a fan of romantic comedies, I never really make a conscious decision to see them in theaters, let alone on opening weekend. I think the first and last time I ever said “I have to go see this” about a movie in this ballpark was Hitch, all the way back in 2005. The same people I know who are glad for some Asian representation onscreen are also the ones that commiserate with me about the lack of good rom-coms. Double win. What about, you, Angela—what were your thoughts coming away from all this?\\n\\nWatercutter: I think you all got at most of what I felt about this movie. To your point, Phuc, I hope that this is the start of something. I hope it gets a lot more movies from Asian filmmakers greenlit so that a wider variety of stories can be told.\\n\\nNow, can I ask an unrelated question? What was everyone’s favorite scene/joke/bit? I mean, I think the mah-jongg scene is going to end up being the one people think about when they think about Crazy Rich Asians years from now, but what else stood out for you guys? For me, I think I laughed the hardest when Jeong called Awkwafina “Ellen,” presumably because of her short blonde ’do. In a movie full of great moments, what were your faves?\\n\\nRaftery: I think Ken Jeong’s just-slightly-off dad—who’s in the movie for just a few minutes—gave the film a comic unpredictability it needed at times, to break up some of the constant backstory logjams. (He was also one of the few characters without any hang-ups, dramas, or big challenges to deal with, which may be why he came off as so relaxed.) He’s really one of the great supporting comedy players of the ’00s, and yet I can’t remember the last time he was so comfortably loosey-goosey as he is here.\\n\\nPham: I’ve been consumed with the idea of Asian masculinity lately: How is it defined? In what ways does it manifest itself? Is it possible to correct for misrepresentation in a way that feels genuine, wholesome, and not ultrabro? Jimmy O. Yang’s character and his over-the-top “boys’ club” bachelor party is pretty representative of the approach of many men who seek advice on r/AsianMasculinity. So seeing Golding and Chris Pang steal away from all that to a secluded beach in order to discuss anxieties surrounding marriage and the future really resonated with me. Sure, their naked abs do something for Asian male representation, but to see the two of them talk candidly about serious feelings-type things reminded me of the men in my life whose support and advice I treasure.\\n\\nCeres: The opening song gave me goosebumps! The first strain of music you hear in the film is this old-Hollywood big band intro. Then the vocalist comes in … and the song is in Mandarin! The first track, “Waiting for Your Return,” is a Chinese jazz classic, delivered with renewed verve and glamor by vocalist Jasmine Chen. It’s a thrilling opening for a thoughtfully curated soundtrack, interspersed with Chinese classics along with covers of American pop songs in Mandarin and Cantonese.\\n\\nI now listen to the soundtrack religiously. When I walk into the office with my headphones in, know that I’m fueling up on confidence from “我的新衣 My New Swag” by Chinese rapper VaVa (feat. Ty. and Nina Wang), and that you shouldn’t mess with me during that time.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'This story originally appeared on The New Republic and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Germany was supposed to be a model for solving global warming. In 2007, the country’s government announced that it would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by the year 2020. This was the kind of bold, aggressive climate goal scientists said was needed in all developed countries. If Germany could do it, it would prove the target possible. So far, Germany has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 27.7 percent—an astonishing achievement for a developed country with a highly developed manufacturing sector. But with a little more than a year left to go, despite dedicating $580 billion toward a low-carbon energy system, the country “is likely to fall short of its goals for reducing harmful carbon-dioxide emissions,” Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. And the reason for that may come down not to any elaborate solar industry plans, but something much simpler: cars. “At the time they set their goals, they were very ambitious,” Patricia Espinosa, the United Nations’ top climate change official, told Bloomberg. “What happened was that the industry—particularly the car industry—didn’t come along.” Changing the way we power our homes and businesses is certainly important. But as Germany’s shortfall shows, the only way to achieve these necessary, aggressive emissions reductions to combat global warming is to overhaul the gas-powered automobile and the culture that surrounds it. The only question left is how to do it.\\n\\nIn 2010, a NASA study declared that automobiles were officially the largest net contributor of climate change pollution in the world. “Cars, buses, and trucks release pollutants and greenhouse gases that promote warming, while emitting few aerosols that counteract it,” the study read. “In contrast, the industrial and power sectors release many of the same gases—with a larger contribution to [warming]—but they also emit sulfates and other aerosols that cause cooling by reflecting light and altering clouds.” In other words, the power generation sector may have emitted the most greenhouse gases in total. But it also released so many sulfates and cooling aerosols that the net impact was less than the automobile industry, according to NASA. Since then, developed countries have cut back on those cooling aerosols for the purpose of countering regular air pollution, which has likely increased the net climate pollution of the power generation industry. But according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, “collectively, cars and trucks account for nearly one-fifth of all U.S. emissions,” while “in total, the US transportation sector—which includes cars, trucks, planes, trains, ships, and freight—produces nearly thirty percent of all US global warming emissions ... .” In fact, transportation is now the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States—and it has been for two years, according to an analysis from the Rhodium Group. There’s a similar pattern happening in Germany. Last year, the country’s greenhouse gas emissions decreased as a whole, “largely thanks to the closure of coal-fired power plants,” according to Reuters. Meanwhile, the transportation industry’s emissions increased by 2.3 percent, “as car ownership expanded and the booming economy meant more heavy vehicles were on the road.” Germany’s transportation sector remains the nation’s second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but if these trends continue, it will soon become the first. Clearly, the power generation industry is changing its ways. So why aren’t carmakers following suit?',\n",
       " 'One of my favorite classes to teach is Physics for Elementary Education. It\\'s a physics class designed to address the needs of future elementary school teachers—grades 1 through 6 or so. To guide the class, I\\'ve been using a version of Next Gen Physical Science and Everyday Thinking for a long time, maybe 13 years or so, and it is super awesome.\\n\\nOne of the major goals in this course is to help students understand the nature of science—in particular the idea that science is all about building and testing models. Throughout the course, the students collect data and build models of their own, but they also learn about existing scientific models, like the heliocentric (sun-centered) model of the solar system.\\n\\nBut there\\'s a problem with just going ahead and assuming that the Earth orbits the sun. For a long time, humans believed in a different model of the solar system: the geocentric, or Earth-centered model. How do we know today which model is correct—or importantly, how can you know it\\'s the best model? Do we just have to rely on what the textbooks tell us?\\n\\nThe answer is no. I am going to go over three things you can observe (using simple tools) to support the idea of a heliocentric model of the solar system. Who needs to depend on those silly textbooks when you can figure stuff out yourself?\\n\\nPhases of Venus\\n\\nJamie Cooper/SSPL/Getty Images\\n\\nFor this observation, you are going to need a pair of binoculars and some time. Step one is to find out when Venus (the planet) is visible from your location. A quick Google search should give you the answer. If it\\'s not up in the sky right now, just wait a few weeks and you should be able to see it again (without having to get up at 4 AM).\\n\\nWhen you look at Venus with the binoculars, you should notice something. First, it\\'s clearly not a star. Second, it\\'s not even circular. The shape of Venus should be similar to the phases of the moon—that\\'s because Venus has phases. Yes, you can have a \"crescent\" looking shape to Venus.\\n\\nBut what does this mean about the geocentric and heliocentric models of the solar system? First, let\\'s recall what causes the phases of the moon—here is a refresher. In short, half of the moon is illuminated by the sun. Since we look at the moon from different angles, we only see part of the illuminated half of the moon and this causes the phases. The exact same thing is true for Venus.\\n\\nSo, if Venus has a crescent-shaped phases, that means that we are looking at the \"back side\" of Venus. If Venus has a full phase, we are looking at the \"front side.\" The only way for this to happen is if Venus orbits the sun. But wait! That doesn\\'t mean the solar system has to be heliocentric. It\\'s still possible that the Earth is at the center and the sun orbits the Earth but Venus orbits the sun. It would be weird—but it\\'s possible.\\n\\nMoons of Jupiter\\n\\nNASA Goddard\\n\\nHere is another thing you can see with a pair of binoculars. Take a look at Jupiter (when it\\'s visible in the sky). If you haven\\'t ever tried this—you need to do this. Trust me. It\\'s pretty awesome. You won\\'t really be able to make out details about the planet Jupiter, but you can see the four big moons. Yes, you can see the moons of Jupiter with binoculars.\\n\\nBut what do these Jupiter moons say about the model of the solar system? Just like the phases of Venus, this doesn\\'t prove that the geocentric model is wrong. However, it is obvious that these moons are orbiting Jupiter and not the Earth. So, Earth isn\\'t the center of everything.\\n\\nRetrograde Motion of Mars\\n\\nThis one is classic—and you don\\'t even need a telescope or anything. You only need some patience. Here\\'s what you do. Go outside at night and notice the location of Mars with respect to the background stars. Do this again the next night and you will notice that it is in a different location (with respect to the background stars). In fact, all of the planets do this—that\\'s how we know they aren\\'t stars.\\n\\nBut if you keep tracking the motion of Mars you will notice that it moves to the east—except for some special times. Occasionally Mars will move west for short time before once again moving east. This is called retrograde motion.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s consider the geocentric model with Mars orbiting the Earth. Every night it would move farther to the east. That makes sense. But how do you explain the times when it moves to the west? That\\'s just crazy.\\n\\nOK, just for fun I\\'m going to make a model of the Mars retrograde motion. If you plot the position of the planet every day, it would look something like this. Note: These aren\\'t real numbers, it\\'s just an example.\\n\\nThe angular position of Mars (fake Mars) keeps increasing from -90 degrees to 90 degrees (and then back to negative 90). This happens until around fake time of 10 (fake time units). Notice that for a short time Mars moves back the other way—boom. That\\'s retrograde motion.\\n\\nNow here is the planetary motion that would make this plot. If you need to re-run this model (in python), just click the \"play button.\"\\n\\nIn this model, both the Earth and Mars orbit a sun—please realize that this model is not to scale. Really, nothing is correct except that the force that causes the orbit is an inverse square law force (just like real gravity). This means that the angular velocity for the planets decreases with orbital distance. The Earth orbits \"faster\" than Mars. It is this region in which the Earth overtakes Mars that we get retrograde motion.\\n\\nUsing a heliocentric model makes for a simple explanation of the retrograde motion of Mars. But again, that doesn\\'t \"prove\" the heliocentric model. But if you take all three of these experiments together you have two options (OK, you could find even more options if you wanted). Option A: The Earth and Mars both orbit the sun. Option B: Mars and the sun orbit the Earth but Mars has a non-circular or some type of funky orbit. Also, Venus still orbits the sun. Option A just seems simpler. Let\\'s go with a heliocentric model of the solar system.\\n\\nAn Argument for Geocentric\\n\\nJust to be clear. Before you did these three experiments (which I\\'m sure you did), it\\'s not such a crazy idea to stick with the geocentric model. If you had never looked at a textbook or watched a YouTube video, would you think the Earth orbits the sun? I think not. It certainly doesn\\'t seem that the Earth is both spinning on its axis once a day as well as moving at 30 kilometers per second (the speed needed to get all the way around the sun in just one year).\\n\\nWouldn\\'t we fly off a spinning Earth? Wouldn\\'t birds have trouble flying to keep up with the Earth? In fact, it just doesn\\'t feel like the Earth is moving. The geocentric model of the solar system is completely reasonable until you start to collect better data. Or, to say this with respect to the Nature of Science: Some models are pretty good until you collect more data that says they aren\\'t good. That is the way science works.\\n\\nEven though there is evidence to support a heliocentric model, historically, there was still one very big problem with it. If the Earth is moving around the sun, then there should be an apparent shift of the positions of stars. This is called stellar parallax. Parallax is the thing your phone uses to place virtual objects in the camera view (like ARkit in Apple\\'s iOS). It turns out that it is super difficult to detect stellar parallax. Stars are very far away so that their shift is too small to notice with crappy telescopes. Better telescopes got us better data, which got us a better model of the solar system.\\n\\nAnother example: the Foucault pendulum. This is basically a long pendulum that changes its plane of oscillation due to the rotation of the Earth. It\\'s difficult to set up so I skipped it up above. But if you bother to build one, you\\'ll get even better data supporting the heliocentric model of the solar system.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'Of all the striking things about the interview with Elon Musk The New York Times published Thursday night—the tears, the lack of regrets over certain tweets, the fact that rapper Azealia Banks may somehow be part of Tesla’s financial future—was Musk’s claim that he’d be ready to abandon his role as Tesla CEO and chairman.\\n\\n“If you have anyone who can do a better job, please let me know. They can have the job,” he told the paper. “Is there someone who can do the job better? They can have the reins right now.”\\n\\nOn the surface, the implication—nobody else can do this—is nonsense. Lots of people could run Tesla. Starting with the hundreds of capable executives at the world’s automakers, most of which are larger, more efficient, and more profitable than Tesla. Go a bit deeper though, and you find the truth of the sentiment. Sure, someone might be a better CEO. But there’s no replacing Elon Musk. Because the man is not just a CEO. To many, the man is a legend.\\n\\nStart with the tale of Tesla. When the company launched in 2003, car salesmen were stocking up on the 12-mpg Hummer H2. The most popular battery-powered vehicles were golf carts. The American auto industry is famously brutal to newcomers, and the idea of one succeeding with electric vehicles racked up the lolz. For years, skeptics waited to bury Tesla alongside Tucker, DeLorean, Fisker. Musk defied them. He made electric cars capable (and sort of self-driving). He made them easy to charge (on an infrastructure he built). But most importantly, he made them desirable. Owning a Tesla became a status symbol; about 400,000 people are on a waiting list to own the Model 3. The entire venture proved you didn’t have to be GM or Ford or Chrysler to make cars in America. And you didn’t have to be BMW or Mercedes or Lexus to make luxury cars appealing to Americans.\\n\\nSimultaneously, Musk was running SpaceX. Under his leadership, the commercial space company defied entrenched aviation giants like Boeing by breaking into the rocket science business. Musk promised to colonize Mars. As his side hustles, he wished a hyperloop industry into creation, dabbled in artificial intelligence, and won a contract to dig tunnels under Chicago.\\n\\nAnd all along the way, much of the world cheered him on. Musk graced magazine covers. He inspired songs. He went on talk shows, appeared on The Simpsons and South Park, made Page Six headlines. Sure, he had a sizable ego (who wouldn’t?) and habit of belittling those who doubted or opposed him (haters!), but the public largely forgave him these minor transgressions given his major skills in proposing big, bold ideas, and delivering on them.\\n\\nBut over the past year, this goodwill has started to fade. Much of that erosion can be traced to Musk’s greatest business struggle: the mass production of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. The car Tesla had long promised, the vehicle that would bring clean driving to the masses and profits to shareholders, that would make Tesla a real automaker. As ever, Musk set ambitious goals and deadlines. As ever, he missed them. A few times over. Investors were used to this, but the company’s future hinged on the Model 3, a reality that evidently intensified the pressure, especially as the production process hit one snag after another. “This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” Musk told the Times. “It was excruciating.” He didn’t contain the pain. In the first half of 2018, he raged at the media, insulted financial analysts during a public call with investors, and attacked the National Transportation Safety Board—the Mr. Rogers of federal agencies.\\n\\nThen, in the final week of June, at the very end of the second quarter, Tesla finally hit its goal of building more than 5,000 Model 3s in a single week (5,031, to be exact), the point at which Musk believes revenue from sales will outweigh the cost of production, and lead to profitability. The automaker has started to offer more versions of the car, indicating it was confident it could keep up the pace. Investors’ confidence in Musk seemed, at long last, justified.\\n\\nIt should have eased the pressure. But Musk kept finding himself the center of unwanted attention. In July, he railed against those saying his efforts to assist in the rescue of a group of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand were more self-aggrandizing than serious. When a diver who helped with the effort insulted him, Musk called him “pedo guy.” (He later apologized.) The same week, he struggled to explain why he donated about $40,000 to a Republican political action committee, given that many Republicans are climate change deniers. None of this inspired confidence in Musk, but Model 3s kept coming off the production line. Investors will forgive a lot if they make their money.\\n\\nLast week, though, Musk’s erratic behavior and his taste for Twitter struck a blow not just to his reputation, but to his company. On Tuesday, he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private, and he had the necessary funding “secured.” The automaker’s stock price shot up, as did eyebrows at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Especially when Musk revealed a few days later that by “secured,” he meant not exactly secured. The SEC is investigating, and serious fines are a possibility. Angered investors have filed four lawsuits—so far. “As a result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements, as well as their market manipulation, Tesla securities purchasers were injured to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,” one reads.\\n\\nThe pressure to perform has eased, but its effects, it seems, endure. Musk cares deeply about what people think of him and his companies. His harsh reactions to negative press often beget more of the same, a surely unsettling shift from the years of mostly adoring coverage he received, of the publicly validated self-worth he must have come to expect. And while he retains a loyal army of Twitter followers, his mantle as a Renaissance Superman, gifted by an enthralled public—and media—is slipping.\\n\\nIn his interview with the Times, Musk said that in terms of Tesla’s operations, the worst is over. “But from a personal pain standpoint,” he said, “the worst is yet to come.” This bodes ill not just for his investors, but for everyone who thinks cars should be fun to drive and good for the planet, who wants to explore space, who believes in a better future.\\n\\nMusk, then, is Hercules remixed. The greatest of Greek heroes performed his famed labors as penance for killing his children in a fit of insanity. Musk has completed his own labors, landing rockets on boats and delivering a wonderful, affordable, electric car. But the effort seems to have left him mad. And now he threatens to destroy what he has created.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'Tesla is no ordinary automaker, and Elon Musk is no ordinary CEO. He makes grand bets and pronouncements, gets cornered by TMZ, and injects himself into spats with other tech luminaries. Occasionally, lawyers get involved.\\n\\nIn the past month or so, a lot of lawyers have gotten involved. On August 7, the Tesla CEO tweeted that he was considering taking his company private, and that he had secured the funding to do so. The latter may not have been completely true, which has drawn the attention of shareholders and federal regulators alike.\\n\\nMeanwhile, ex-employees have filed two whistle-blower complaints with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging retaliation and the coverup of a drug ring. Others say they were improperly fired from the company, or that it improperly interfered with potential board members. And at least four Tesla shareholders have accused the company of fraud and market manipulation—and one wants everyone who purchased Tesla securities after that tweet to join his case. Meanwhile, the SEC has reportedly opened a probe into Musk’s Twitter activity; the commission served the electric car maker with subpoenas on last week.\\n\\nThere is a lot happening, and with the fate of Tesla far from certain, it’s a good moment to pause and run through some of the wildest allegations thrown about in the last three months, which fall on a spectrum from “yeesh” to “yikes” to “Holy Mother of God.” Of course, these lawsuits are all based on allegations at this point. Nothing has been proven yet, and lawsuits tend to come with the territory when you’re running a big company. These will (likely) play out slowly, and hopefully with heapings of thoughtful deliberation and hard evidence, within the justice system. But in the meantime, expect them to serve as frustrating mountains (or mole hills) to scale as the company continues to work on ramping up its vehicle production.\\n\\nThe Martin Tripp Complaint\\n\\nOn July 11, a former Tesla technician named Martin Tripp filed a whistle-blower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging Tesla had lied to investors about production numbers and knowingly used damaged batteries and scrapped parts in its cars. Tesla denies the allegations, and says it fired Tripp for leaking information to reporters, stealing trade secrets, and hacking into the company’s computer systems. In June, it sued Tripp for hacking and trade secret theft.\\n\\nLast week, Tripp tweeted out internal photos and emails that he says corroborate his claims. The former employee deleted his Twitter account a day later.\\n\\nIn a statement to WIRED, a Tesla spokesperson called the claims false: “Mr. Tripp does not even have personal knowledge about the safety claims that he is making. No punctured cells have ever been used in any Model 3 vehicles in any way, and all VINs that have been identified have safe batteries. Notably, there have been zero battery safety issues in any Model 3.”\\n\\nKarl Hansen Complaint\\n\\nLast Thursday, another former member of Tesla’s internal security department filed a whistle-blower complaint with the SEC, and this one—if you can believe it—is even stranger. Karl Hansen alleges that the electric car maker failed to inform its shareholders and law enforcement that it had uncovered an employee-run drug trafficking scheme out of its Nevada Gigafactory battery plant.\\n\\nIn a summary of the complaint reviewed by Jalopnik, Hansen wrote that in May, the Drug Enforcement Administration informed the automaker that “a Tesla employee may be a participant in a narcotics trafficking ring involving the sale of significant quantities of cocaine and possibly crystal methamphetamine at the Gigafactory on behalf of a Mexican drug cartel from Sonora, Mexico.” (In a statement, the DEA told BuzzFeed it “does not notify non-law enforcement entities of ongoing or pending investigations.”) Hansen says he told Tesla that he had confirmed this law enforcement tip in mid-June, but that the company did not inform board members or the public.\\n\\n“This guy is super [peanut emoji],” Musk told Gizmodo in a Twitter direct message. “He is simultaneously saying that our security sucks (it’s not great, but I’m pretty sure we aren’t a branch of the Sinaloa cartel like he claims) and that we have amazing spying ability. Those can’t both be true.”\\n\\nA Tesla spokesperson told WIRED the company took Hansen’s allegations “very seriously,” that some are false, and that when it tried to corroborate his claims, Hansen was unresponsive. “We made numerous attempts to engage further with Mr. Hansen to understand more about what he was claiming and the work that he did in reaching his conclusions. He rejected each of those attempts, and to date has refused to speak with the company further,” the spokesperson said.\\n\\nShareholder Lawsuits\\n\\nLast week, Musk sent Tesla shares a’bouncing when he suddenly announced on Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private, and that he had secured the funding to do so. But over the course of the next few days, it became clear that the funding wasn’t quite secure. So on August 10, a short seller named Kalman Isaacs filed a class-action lawsuit against Musk and Tesla on behalf of everyone who bought Tesla securities after the tweet. Isaacs’ complaint alleges that Musk meant to lie—that he knew funding wasn’t secured but hoped to squeeze the short sellers who so frustrate him. “As a result of Defendants’ materially false and misleading statements, as well as their market manipulation, Tesla securities purchasers were injured to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars,” the lawsuit, filed in the Northern District Court of California, reads. Other shareholders have filed at least three similar lawsuits, all in the same California court and seeking restitution for funds lost during early August’s market rollercoaster. (Tesla shares climbed 11 percent following Musk’s twitter announcement but have since fallen, especially after Musk granted a glum and emotional interview with The New York Times.) A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.\\n\\nCarlos Ramirez\\n\\nIn June, Tesla’s former director of environmental, health, safety, and sustainability, a man named Carlos Ramirez, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination. According to his suit, filed in Alameda County Superior Court in California, Ramirez alleges he uncovered flaws in the company’s incident reporting system at its Fremont, California, plant, including “numerous instances of lack of treatment of Tesla employees that suffered workplace injuries, recordkeeping violations, and improper classification of workplace injuries to avoid treating and reporting workplace injuries.” Ramirez’s complaint claims that he alerted Tesla management to these issues, but that the company ignored them, failed to notify the public or state agencies, and then fired him weeks later.\\n\\nTesla says Ramirez was not fired for reporting the system flaws, but instead for inappropriate workplace conduct. “It was clear that he had engaged over and over again in harassing workplace behavior and used extremely inappropriate language that violated any reasonable standard,” a Tesla spokesperson said in an extensive statement, published in full by Jalopnik. Representatives for Tesla and Ramirez are set to meet before a judge in late October.\\n\\nThe SEC\\n\\nWhen Elon Musk posted that “funding secured” tweet earlier this month, he not only launched himself into the crosshairs of litigious shareholders—he also reportedly caught the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The federal agency is said to be looking into the circumstances surrounding the tweet, as well as Tesla’s take-private scheme, and reportedly issued Tesla subpoenas last week.\\n\\nTo be sure, many investigations don’t result in charges. But should the SEC choose to do so, it could sanction or sue the electric car maker for fraud or even market manipulation, according to John Coffee Jr., a Columbia Law School professor who studies corporations and securities regulation. If the SEC does bring a suit, experts say Musk and Co. are better off settling quickly, because a loss in court could mean writing million-dollar paychecks. Indeed, Fox Business reports that the tweet has already cost Tesla big bucks, millions in fees to law firms.\\n\\nIt’s yet another thing for a busy electric car maker to deal with, as it tries to reshape the world.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"Rolling into San Francisco’s new bus terminal has all the vibes of docking with a Googie space station—the weird, special bridge into the hangar, the orange color accents behind a white superstructure, glowing information screens everywhere. The hieroglyphically obtuse wayfinding signage only adds to the effect. I may have gotten on a bus in the East Bay, but I’m disembarking on Space Station V, in transit to Clavius.\\n\\nThat’s no moon. It’s the “Salesforce Transit Center” (owing to a naming-rights deal with the company that owns the skyscraper next door), a $2.26 billion hub for the city’s Muni buses, as well as buses from across the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges—and Greyhound. Some day, if all goes as planned, it’ll be where California’s commuter and high-speed rail lines arrive in San Francisco.\\n\\nThe station is a white whale eight years in the making (and that’s just the construction bit), a crystalline Moby Dick with Penrose-tile skin breaching the downtown grid and drafting the psychogeographic currents around glass-and-steel towers. I like it; San Francisco feels new there, and even though a building that’s aesthetically to my taste might not be to yours, there’s urban glory in bustle, in elegant skyways and in clotted mazes of streets opening onto a broad pedestrian plaza. I like the aluminum screen, and I like the orange walls inside, though I’m suspicious about how well they’ll age as color fashions change and urban soot and fungus go looking for new substrate. The big, main open space of the station has a beautiful tile floor under a grand light well, and its high escalator makes it feel like a place where a human can make a big entrance or a big exit. If you don’t have a downtown cathedral, at least you can have a downtown transit station.\\n\\nThe station isn’t complete. Street-level spaces I assume will be for retail and restaurants haven’t opened yet. Workers are still finishing planters and sidewalks. An entire floor that’ll be a food court is still bare concrete. So it’s hard to know whether the station will do all the things that a grand transit node does in other cities—a Gare du Nord or a Shinjuku. It has no shops yet, no place to buy a beer for the ride and a bouquet for your honey, food for dinner, a pair of reading glasses, a magazine (OK, no one buys those), an aspirin. Nobody is playing drums on plastic buckets next to an escalator. There are no homeless people, and the almost total absence of places to sit suggests an attempt to design them out of existence.\\n\\nI’m being intentionally unfair here; Gare du Nord sees 700,000 people a day and Shinjuku more than 3.5 million. The Transbay’s peak capacity is 24,000. This is a small-town station with big-city ambitions. But the thing is, when you start to ask questions about what the station does not have, they multiply. It aspires to be a beating heart for the city, but this “Grand Central of the West” isn’t connected to the rest of the circulatory system.\\n\\nThe $2.26 billion transportation complex looks lovely: a crystalline Moby Dick with Penrose-tile skin breaching the downtown grid and drafting the psychogeographic currents around glass-and-steel towers. Karl Mondon/Digital First Media/Getty Images\\n\\nAfter the ride down that escalator, the experience slides from grand to confusing. Wayfinding signs give general directions—Muni this way, Amtrak over there—but without the specificity that could help get travelers from this bit of the city to the rest. San Francisco’s grand Ferry Building, itself a transbay transit hub, is half a mile away, a 10 minute walk. Not only is there no direct connection from the Transit Center, there’s not even signage indicating how to get from one to the other, nor a protected bike path.\\n\\n(That’s another question that demands more questions. With all the sidewalk-rending construction of the past decade downtown, how is there no protected bike path from the Caltrain commuter rail station to the Salesforce Transit Center? For that matter, how is there no protected bike path connecting the Ferry Building to the Golden Gate Bridge?)\\n\\nThe broad plaza I like on the transit center’s south side—it’ll be a bigger park eventually, and it already has food trucks—connects to narrow little Natoma Street. That's where the bike lockers and bike-share dock are (until phase two puts them under the terminal), and what has become, with the terminal’s opening, the luckiest bar in the city. Keep walking on Natoma, and if you can manage to get across busy New Montgomery (there’s no light or crosswalk), you get to amble down what another town might call a paseo, and might even put little stalls for coffee and tchotchkes in, if citizens on foot were allowed to enjoy themselves. That puts you at a hidden inside elbow of the new SF Museum of Modern Art, a cute secret courtyard that angles you out toward another little paseo … across a multiple-lane street without a crosswalk. There are planters that try to keep you from attempting the jaywalk. I do it anyway.\\n\\nOh, but the hilarious part: Turn right at those planters and you see you are a block away from San Francisco’s nearly-completed, newly rebuilt convention center. Yes! An easy, sub-10-minute, mostly car-free walk connects the Transit Center to one of the city’s major destinations. This, apparently, is a mildly dangerous secret. Presumably it won’t remain that way, because in a month basically everyone in that adjacent naming-rights skyscraper will be walking that way to get to the annual Dreamforce conference—last year it hosted more than 170,000 people. Expect a lot of jaywalking.\\n\\nThe ride down the escalator is grand. Then things get confusing. Karl Mondon/Digital First Media/Getty Images\\n\\nPhase two of construction on the project aims to more firmly embed the terminal in the city’s fabric. The heavy rail lines that today end at a station about a mile south will go underground and stop in the Transbay’s basement. An 800-foot tunnel will connect that basement to a subway station a block and a half away that also serves San Francisco’s electric trolley line and abuts a cable car stop. The timeline for all that is somewhere between “inshallah” and “alas.”\\n\\nThe missed-connections theme picks back up with the Transit Center’s marquee feature, its rooftop park. Salesforce Park is open to the public and includes nearly 5.5 acres of grass, undulating hills, and some really interesting plantings that represent different California biomes, with good signage explaining what’s what. The green space doubles as gray-water treatment for the building, and it enfolds performance spaces, carts with games to play, coffee carts, seating areas … look, it’s pretty charming. Cities too often force a binary choice between being street-level or up high. Salesforce Park literally forces you to have a new perspective on San Francisco; a walk in the park means being able to look into the windows of the adjacent office buildings, and I like being at eye level with their giant light-up signs. Of course, some local wags have dubbed the park “San Francisco’s High Line.” (Every time a West Coast city names some feature after one in New York I lose more ground in my war to make the East Coast irrelevant.)\\n\\nBut like the High Line, the Transit Center is less a park and more a walled garden. It is access-controlled. Two adjacent buildings have their own entrances; other than that, you have to go up through the terminal or, when it’s finished, ride a (very cool looking) cable car up from street level.\\n\\nThis only matters programmatically. Which is to say, controlling access controls the uses of the park. There will never be a political demonstration in Salesforce Park. There will never be unapproved buskers. The trees and grass don’t touch the ground; their roots are literally up in the air. The park is open to the public, but it is not a public park, if you see what I mean.\\n\\nWould I rather the Transit Center had captured its aerial value some other way? A residential tower/hotel on one side, a commercial skyscraper on the other? Yeah, I probably would like that, because I am the kind of person who thinks Shinjukus and Gare du Nords are more than emblems. I love the form of the Salesforce Transit Center. I just wish it were following more functions.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'Nick Millington had just started to feel like a successful software engineer. It was early 2003, and at age 26 he already had a fruitful career at Microsoft. He feared his one-bedroom apartment in Redmond, Washington—filled with a mishmash of bargain-bin furniture and DIY shelving made of cinderblocks and wood planks—wasn\\'t representative of his upward mobility. He wasn\\'t a starving student anymore, he was an adult. So Millington did what we all do once we\\'re able: He bought a larger, more elegant apartment and filled it with brand-new stuff. \"I was starting to think more about the design of my home,\" Millington says. \"You know, upgrading to the fancier Ikea furniture that looked nice.\" Sonos chief product officer Nick Millington. Sonos One nagging problem was how to rig up his music system. Digital music was exploding on the internet, and Millington had spent many hours methodically trying to collect every Billboard Top 40 hit from 1945 onward, amassing a wide range of other, more eclectic music files along the way. But listening to his treasure trove of tunes felt like living in the dorms again. All of his MP3s were stored on the boxy PC he kept in his living room. \"At the time, my music setup was a Gateway 2000 tower PC and then I had a laptop,\" he says. \"I would do terminal server into the PC and play MP3 files there. That wasn\\'t cutting it for me.\" Around that same time, a Santa Barbara, California, startup called Sonos was hiring engineers. Sonos courted Millington with a simple pitch: It wanted to make digital music players that would look respectable on his \"fancier\" Ikea shelves, wirelessly access his MP3s without requiring him to touch a PC, and play all of his music in every room of his house. Millington wanted in. Now, 15 years later, Nick Millington is the chief product officer at Sonos: the guy responsible for all of the company\\'s speakers and software. When I meet him at Sonos\\' East Coast headquarters in Boston, he\\'s dressed like an archetypical engineer, in a plaid, short-sleeved shirt. Framing his round face is brown hair that\\'s kept in check but seems to be waiting for the chance to poof and curl. He looks both completely put together and a dash disheveled all at once. Millington is named as an inventor on 69 Sonos patents, with 33 others pending—a significant portion of the company\\'s entire portfolio, which numbers around 500 patents. He also developed the core networking framework that keeps the playback of multiple Sonos speakers throughout a home in perfect sync. His work was central to the company\\'s early adoption of apps and its expansion from amps to speakers. Yet, even though his efforts have proven critical to the company\\'s success, Millington tends to credit others a lot more than himself. He seems more concerned with solving problems than bragging about his solutions, which may be why he\\'s never sought a greater spotlight or given an in-depth interview before talking to WIRED. Since 2005, Sonos has sold 19 million audio devices—each of them a representation of the work done by Millington and his team—into 7 million homes. The same speakers still top many best-of guides. By most measures, it\\'s a story of success. In the future, Millington hints, Sonos may create its first speakers and audio products designed to leave the house. But today, Sonos is sailing rougher seas. Cofounder and CEO John MacFarlane resigned in early 2017 and was replaced by COO Patrick Spence. The company has also had more than one round of layoffs as it has dealt with an evolving competitive landscape. The rise of the voice-assistant smart speaker, in particular, took the company by surprise. Just this year, shortly before going public, Sonos released a new soundbar that interacts with voice services from Apple, Amazon, and soon, Google—the same tech giants who have charged forcefully into the multiroom wireless speaker market Sonos built. It will be up to Millington and his product team to chart a course through the choppy, frenemy-filled waters ahead. To do it, he may help guide the company into new places altogether. Until now, all Sonos products have been shackled to rooms inside your home. In the future, Millington hints, Sonos may create its first speakers and audio products designed to leave the house.\\n\\nMillington is used to leaving houses. As the son of a British Diplomatic Service officer, he spent his entire childhood globetrotting, but it was his time as a kid in Japan in the 1980s—an era when the country was the worldwide epicenter for electronic innovation—that set him on a path toward tech. \"There was an area of Tokyo called Akihabara, which is where there were all of these tech companies and these stores where you could go buy endless arrays of parts, and incredibly cheap floppy disks and all sorts of equipment,\" Millington says. \"I used to go almost every weekend with a few geeky friends of mine and check out various developments and things like that.\" He learned about networking early on as well, subscribing to the first dialup internet service provider in Japan, called TWICS. He ran a Tokyo PC users group on a bulletin board system that predated the web. Eventually, he landed at Duke University in the US and then went to Microsoft when he graduated in 1998, where he worked on SharePoint, the software maker\\'s online collaboration platform. When Sonos was founded, in 2002, there was no streaming music. No Spotify. No Pandora. AOL dialup was the most popular way to access the internet, and many families didn\\'t even have Wi-Fi yet. iTunes was popularizing the concept of legal music downloads, and file-sharing services like Kazaa were growing in popularity as the music industry reeled in the wake of Napster. Buying Guide: Which Sonos Speaker Should You Buy? The four founders of Sonos, led by MacFarlane, recognized that digital music would increasingly become a bigger part of consumer\\'s lives. Their big idea was an ambitious plan to make it possible for anyone to set up a multiroom home speaker network for digital music. At the time, multiroom systems could be purchased, but they were inaccessible. \"The technology was very cumbersome,\" Millington says. \"It was difficult to set up. It was typically the domain of high-end installers charging very high prices for stuff that didn\\'t always work terribly well. Sometimes you had to actually rebuild your home to put in the necessary wiring and speakers.\" Their plan was to democratize the whole stack. Instead of requiring dedicated wiring or a team of professional installers, Sonos would create Wi-Fi amplifiers (\"ZonePlayers\") that you could tether to the speakers you already owned. Set a Sonos amp in any room of your house, and digital music could be summoned from your computer using a dedicated wireless remote control. You\\'d be able to move your speaker setup to new rooms, alter which speakers were grouped together, and take the whole arrangement with you if you bought a new home. Probes test the Wi-Fi antenna performance of a Sonos speaker. Jeffrey Van Camp By early 2003, the founders had hired Andy Schulert to head up product development. He quickly called on Millington, an old Microsoft colleague, to help solve the most daunting problem the company was facing: how to develop networking tech that would flawlessly sync multiple amplifiers together, transport music between them, and keep them connected and updated through the internet—all over Wi-Fi, which was far less mature back then. Despite having no audio experience \"except for 10 years of piano lessons,\" Millington moved to Santa Barbara and taught himself what he needed to know about audio synchronization in a matter of weeks. \"We had a saying in the early days of Sonos that if there\\'s one thing that absolutely has to work in version 1 of the software it\\'s the ability to upgrade to version 1.1,\" Millington says. \"But if there are two things that have to work, then the audio transport is definitely the core part of it. I have always liked to gravitate toward the core problem where \\'If we don\\'t solve this, we have no product\\' and make sure that it\\'s handled in the best possible way.\" Syncing amps (and their speakers) wasn\\'t easy. One of the big challenges with multiple speakers is dealing with the accuracy of the human ear, which can quickly detect audio that\\'s out of sync. \"The way that you perceive stereo [sound] is with differences in time when the signal arrives at your right ear and your left ear,\" Millington explains. \"If that is moving around or it\\'s off, it will seem like the sound is coming from a different location, and it can be quite quite disconcerting. You need to synchronize it to less than a millisecond of accuracy to have it be a really pleasurable experience.\" To get multiple speakers to sync that closely, Millington developed a method of time-stamping all the music traveling between speakers, thereby holding each speaker accountable. Timestamping made it virtually impossible for Sonos ZonePlayers to get out of sync. Want to give Alexa an audio upgrade? Read our review of the Sonos One smart speaker. The team made another important choice around this time. Instead of designating a permanent master ZonePlayer that centrally ran the entire network, the team created a distributed network in which every Player acted on its own and intelligently communicated with the others—no easy task. For example, if a user had five ZonePlayers hooked up, Millington couldn\\'t let all five of them fetch music from the internet. It would suck up too much bandwidth and potentially crush a home network. So he developed a \"delegation\" process that allowed every ZonePlayer to dynamically assign duties to one another. If one ZonePlayer was removed from the network, another one could pick up the slack and take over its duties—even fetching the music for all the Players, if necessary. Unfortunately, none of this worked over Wi-Fi yet. John MacFarlane was adamant that the whole system work wirelessly, so Millington turned to mesh networking. This method offers a way to wirelessly connect devices in an ad hoc fashion, so you don\\'t need to rely on a central traffic point like a router to keep the network humming. Millington taught himself mesh networking in about six weeks. By early 2004, Sonos\\' wireless mesh networking system was working. Owners would be able to run up to 32 Sonos players in their home, grouping and ungrouping them at will to bundle rooms together, play the same music across an entire floor of their house, or use each player separately. But code that works in the lab still has to pass real-world tests. Millington and the crew began traveling to homes with different Wi-Fi setups near Sonos\\' East Coast headquarters in Boston and its West-Coast headquarters in Santa Barbara. They had to figure out what microwaves and cordless phones might do to a Sonos player under the same roof. In the early days of wireless networking, many products didn\\'t use Wi-Fi as frugally as they do today, and some were major bandwidth hogs, causing a lot of headaches for the team. It was tempting to take the easy road and blame someone\\'s Wi-Fi for everything that went wrong. But for Sonos to succeed as a product, it had to operate in less-than-ideal wireless environments, and several months of troubleshooting ensued. The intense amount of testing the team went through in that prelaunch phase has been immortalized in code; all Sonos products are packed with onboard Wi-Fi diagnostic tools that can send reports to customer service reps when speakers start having problems. Space Oddity Sonos\\' earliest products were amps, and you connected your own speakers. The company\\'s iPod-like hardware remote could control it all. Sonos The first Sonos ZonePlayer (ZP100) hit store shelves in early 2005 as part of a $1,199 bundle that included two amplifiers and a physical wireless remote controller. That wireless controller had a screen and direction pad so you could play music without a PC. Some engineers affectionately referred to it as a \"Russian iPod\" because of its chunky, jog-wheel-bedecked design. But it was useful, displaying album art and song titles on a small screen, and giving users the ability to group and ungroup speakers. The company also made a strong effort to simplify setup with three-step instructions. At launch, the ZP100 was a niche proposition. Wireless multiroom systems were entirely new. Sonos players, though cheaper than a professionally installed wired system, were still fairly expensive, and the fact that they required you to purchase your own speakers was tough to communicate to a mass audience. Hardcore audiophiles likely understood it, but many of them were already in the market for (or owned) a professional setup. Still, for a startup like Sonos, it was a promising debut. The team believed the product worked really well and was reliable, and initial sales were at least decent. As word of mouth began to spread and new ZonePlayer amps arrived, Sonos gained more attention. All-In on iPhone With the concept of networked audio proven and Sonos\\' amp business up and running, Millington was promoted to director of advanced development and architecture in 2006. In his new role, he assembled a small team of half a dozen engineers to create bold, innovative product ideas—a skunkworks team of sorts. While the rest of the company maintained and improved those wireless amps, he began working on new concepts. One of his first projects turned out to be a critical milestone for Sonos. With Millington at the helm, Sonos launched its first iPhone app in late 2008—the same year the App Store launched. The company debated whether to charge for the app (nobody knew how much apps should really cost back then) but decided to make it free. Millington credits the other founders, particularly MacFarlane, for the brisk adoption of iOS. MacFarlane\\'s \"a guy who lives three or four years in the future, and he takes for granted things that don\\'t actually exist yet, is kind of how I would describe his mindset,\" Millington tells me with a smile. \"He really gave us the push in that area.\" The app eliminated the need for a host PC or that \"Russian iPod\" wireless controller. In the years that followed, Millington and the team continued to flesh out the app and began adding direct access to music streaming services as listeners stopped hoarding MP3s on their home computer and began turning to services like Pandora, Rhapsody, and Spotify. Sonos also made a critical decision around this time that continues to define what the company is about: It chose to remain an open platform. The company decided against making its own music service and instead began working to support every audio service on the market in a completely neutral way. \"Sonos is a level playing field for these services to compete for users\\' attentions and subscriptions. We\\'ve never taken any money from a music service or promoted any one of them [over the others],\" Millington says. \"I think the services appreciate that.\" The Sonos app eventually grew to support around 100 services globally, more than any similar platform. The First Sonos Speaker The next milestone project for Millington\\'s team was a full-fledged speaker for Sonos. In early 2008, he hired an audio engineer named Chris Kallai, a self-described \"audio nut\" who had spent time at Harman and Velodyne. In its early years, Sonos focused on amplifiers instead of speakers because it seemed too difficult for an unknown brand to launch a speaker as its first product. There were a lot of established companies in the space. Executives also believed that users and reviewers tended to judge speakers differently than amps. Amps are almost always evaluated objectively. With speakers, however, each listener tends to favor their preferred sound signatures. \"There was just a lot of snake oil and folklore around which ones sound good and which ones don\\'t, and things like that,\" Millington says. \"You know the nice thing about an amplifier is you can measure whether it sounds good or not. Either it reproduces the input or it doesn\\'t, whereas with a speaker it\\'s much more subjective.\" To solve the problem, the company decided to avoid creating a \"Sonos sound\" of its own. Kallai, Millington, and others decided Sonos speakers would try to replicate what recording engineers heard in the studio as they recorded albums. They assembled a group of recording artists and engineers to help. Several notable names in music, including Rick Rubin, joined the group. (Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George Martin and overseer of many recent Beatles remasterings, currently heads it up.) An early Sonos Play:5 speaker. Sonos With Kallai\\'s help, Sonos shipped the $399 Play:5 speaker in 2009. Millington and others described this as a turning point for the company because of how much it simplified the Sonos proposition. Combined with the new iPhone app, it was a speaker that worked out of the box and sounded fantastic. It could be used alone or be networked with as many as 31 pieces of Sonos hardware—other Play:5 speakers or older ZonePlayers. It also got more capable over time, thanks to firmware updates that downloaded and installed from the app—refreshing all speakers at once. \"In some ways you can think of [the Play:5] as the first smart speaker in the sense that it\\'s internet-connected, runs software, connects to music services, and can make music itself rather than being hooked up to an external amplifier and speakers,\" Millington says. The Play:5 earned relatively high marks from reviewers, who liked its sound and features. It helps that the Play:5 stood out among what seemed like a sea of home speakers with iPod docks or then-subpar Bluetooth radios. Let the Good Times Roll The success of products like the Play:5 and iPhone app led to a promotion for Millington. He was put in charge of the entire product department at Sonos in early 2010. Throughout the next few years, more and more music listeners began to rely on their phones to stream songs, and for anyone who liked using an app, Sonos became an attractive idea. The company enjoyed a wave of growth and recognition as a leader in multiroom audio during these years, adding speakers like the petite $200 Play:1 (the top-selling Sonos speaker) and Playbar soundbar to its lineup. Eventually, Sonos came full circle and revamped the Play:5, giving it touch controls and a modern exterior. Sonos speakers undergo testing at its Boston lab. On the table are Play:5 speakers, a Playbar, and a Playbase. On the floor are Subs, the company\\'s wireless subwoofers. Jeffrey Van Camp In early 2014, Sonos redesigned its smartphone app, adding a universal music search that let you hunt through all your music services at once. Later that year, an update eliminated the need to physically plug one of your speakers/amps into your home router to create a Sonos network. All of a sudden, every Sonos player could just connect via Wi-Fi, further simplifying setup. But at the end of 2014, things began to change. Amazon released a small voice-powered speaker called the Echo. It didn\\'t sound very good, and Sonos didn\\'t recognize it as a threat. But the Echo quietly kicked off an entirely new wave of smart speakers powered by voice control. Just as things were beginning to get comfortable, the ground beneath Millington and his team\\'s feet began to shift.\\n\\nA peek inside the Sonos lab. Sonos After I finish my multihour chat with Nick Millington in the \"Fenway\" meeting room at Sonos\\' Boston office, hardware lab manager Jim Weineck whisks me away to give me a full tour of the company\\'s labs, where products, new and old, are put through their paces. The facility is intense. Many testing chambers look like massive bank vaults from the outside, and it\\'s not uncommon to see huge foam cones protruding from the walls and ceilings. In one chamber, speakers are stress-tested by having special pink noise tones piped through them for several months at a time. Pink noise sounds a lot like white noise, but it contains frequencies that are better for testing audio systems. (I was told that, in the Santa Barbara offices, Sonos had 64 Play:1 speakers playing audio at maximum volume for 12 months straight using a custom-designed tone. This tone, called \"life test noise,\" simulates a bunch of songs across all genres at once, and pumping it through the speakers for a year can simulate 10 years of playback.) In another room the size of a walk-in freezer, a huge circular array of probes studies how well the Wi-Fi antennas in Sonos products pick up and emit a signal. A monitor shows me a 3-D Wi-Fi cloud for the Sonos Playbase, which appears to have a tough time picking up signals directly below it. Other rooms test for things like the long-term effects of extreme temperatures, static electricity and how it impacts touch controls, and unintentional radiation. On the tour, one engineer tells me Sonos speakers are packed with more antennas and connectivity tech than they actually need. The team even tries to squeeze in features that may not be used yet, knowing they might be activated in the future via a software update. Whenever Sonos releases new updates, it takes pains to make sure older hardware still works reliably. Millington and other employees say there are still ZP100s out there, serving up music in 2018 just like they did in 2005. Quite a few of them, actually. Sonos claims that 93 percent of all the players it has sold are still in use—a figure that stands out in a tech world where internet-connected products increasingly seem to die on a whim. A speaker is evaluated inside the anechoic chamber. Sonos Weineck leads me into Sonos\\' anechoic acoustic chamber, my favorite part of the tour. It\\'s a two-story vault with a door so heavy it needs to be operated electronically. Inside, the room is completely silent. The walls and ceiling are covered with bundles of foot-long, gray, triangular prisms that absorb all sound and cancel any reverberations. The floor is a trampoline-like mesh material topped with a metal wire grid. If you peer through the mesh, you can see that you\\'re suspended about 10 feet off the gray, foamy ground. In the center of the room is a pedestal where a speaker sits with an arced pole of microphones in front of it. These mics capture and map the sound that comes out of a speaker. The Sonos Beam adds voice control to your home theater. Read our review. Standing in a silent chamber is oddly unnerving. Weineck tells me that with the lights out, people start to go crazy after a few minutes in the vault because they lose all sense of space and direction. All they can hear is their own heartbeat. As soon as he tells me this, I too swear I can hear my own organs pulsating. Other areas of the facility hold Faraday cages that block outside signals to create a pure environment where Sonos can test the Wi-Fi access points of its speakers (a necessity in a building filled with hundreds of internet-connected devices). A 3-D-printing room lets designers quickly mock up new product ideas. Weineck describes a couple of rooms as \"teleconferencing on steroids\" thanks to their electronic whiteboards, highly sensitive directional microphones, and a surgical camera mounted to the ceiling. The camera is precise enough to zoom in on the threading of a screw. The Santa Barbara offices have rooms identical to these here in Boston, enabling worldwide nitpicking as teams on each coast work together to perfect the look or sound of a new speaker. Notes of humanity peek through the sterile jungle of lab equipment on concrete floors. I notice jokes posted on the walls and oddly placed toys, like a shark sitting atop test equipment, hinting that there is at least a little time for play in the audio labs. In a woodworking lab, some employees pulled a prank on an engineer\\'s tendency to meticulously label his supplies by labeling absolutely everything in the room when he was on vacation, including his sink and chair. They laughed, telling me it was to help him \"get back up to speed quickly.\" There are also Obi-Wan Kenobi photos saying \"this is not the room you\\'re looking for\" cheekily plastered on some of the more mysterious doors in the labs during my visit. Like a good stormtrooper, I move along, but I also wonder what the audio Jedi are up to in those secret labs.',\n",
       " 'Policymakers at all levels of government are struggling to thoughtfully harness data in the service of public values. Many public servants grew up in an era of firmly separate disciplines: You were either an engineer or an economist, either a programmer or a social worker, but never both. In an era in which data is everything, the risks to core democratic principles—equity, fairness, support for the most vulnerable, delivery of effective government services—caused by technological illiteracy in policymakers, and policy illiteracy in computer scientists, are staggering.\\n\\nThis has happened because traditional academic disciplines, as they currently operate, often aren\\'t designed to help students study and apply technical expertise to advance the public interest (as distinct from advancing commercial interests). Students doggedly find their own public interest paths; in fact, the digital generation now in college and graduate school craves meaningful work that will change the world. As long as they can make ends meet, they\\'ll happily work for less money in public interest jobs in government and nonprofits. But most universities haven\\'t provided pathways for these digital natives to cross-train in policy and computer science by working on real problems, or to combine expertise in data science with the capacity to think deeply about the ethical and social implications of the use of digital technology.\\n\\nSusan Crawford (@scrawford) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED, a professor at Harvard Law School, and author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age.\\n\\nIn traditional academic settings, every public-policy-minded technologist feels a little lonely, fruitlessly attempting to cross-register into courses that might provide a few snippets of legal and policy skills or allow them to apply their coding abilities to a real, live public problem. Landing internships and fellowships can feel like guerrilla warfare to these scrappy students. This has to change—and now a consortium of foundations and academics is looking for solutions.\\n\\nLast month, a hand-picked group of university presidents and provosts from across the country, plus a few university faculty members, met for two days at an estate-turned-conference center on Long Island to catalyze the intentional creation of a new academic field aimed at addressing precisely this gap in interdisciplinary opportunities. This new area, \"public interest technology,\" is still being defined; it encompasses designing public policy and laws with an awareness of how technology actually works, as well as ensuring that technology is being used to serve public values of fairness and equity. It means consciously thinking about the welfare of society in general, rather than the incentives of a single company.\\n\\nThe group was convened by Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, Larry Kramer, president of the Hewlett Foundation, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and CEO of New America, all of whom are deeply interested in solving the high-stakes problems of siloed training for students who want to serve, plus underequipped policymakers. The presidents and provosts, a high-minded yet deeply practical bunch, took their seats in a converted indoor equestrian training ring—think enormous elliptical conference table surrounding carpeted acreage, with a giant glass skylight overhead—listened attentively, and spoke thoughtfully. I was there, at one point walking around the inside of the ring to moderate part of the conversation. It felt like an important meeting.\\n\\nFord and Hewlett are nudging universities to commit themselves to this new field, drawing an analogy to public interest law. Not too many decades ago, there weren\\'t clear professional pathways for law students who wanted to serve the public rather than private clients, although the need for services was overwhelming. The Ford Foundation, in particular, seeded the development of clinics that gave opportunities to law students to learn to act like lawyers while still in school; a world of fellowships, internships, published research, and loan forgiveness programs funded by a host of actors followed. The foundations believe that solving the problem of inadequate public interest technology services and pathways in America similarly requires intentional cross-disciplinary curriculum development and student support. And they don\\'t intend to fund all of this themselves; they are cajoling universities to concentrate their fund-raising efforts on supporting this new field.\\n\\nTraditional universities are particularly well-suited to making this digital-age flavor of training happen. Their buildings can be meeting places for public officials, supervisors, and students to work together on crucial policy problems. The University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon University are ahead of the game, already intentionally pulling together resources and faculty and offering new programs at the nexus of ethical technology and policy, but many others are committed to promoting similar collaborative work across departments.\\n\\nMIT and Georgetown Law School, for example, run a joint experiential course that brings law students and MIT technologists together to work on privacy-related problems; Princeton\\'s Center for Information Technology Policy takes students to Washington, DC, for a three-day Tech Policy Boot Camp. Much is happening; much more could be done, and far more systematically.\\n\\nThis is a powerful field-development trick: Attendees had to write down answers to questions like \"How will you develop new resources and mobilize existing funding mechanisms to expand the field?\" If the writer didn\\'t want to commit, they could say, \"We [the group of attendees] should\" do X or Y. And a final option was \"someone should\" do tasks that seemed beyond the remit of the group in the room.\\n\\nThe written commitments that emerged from the presidents and provosts were striking: \"I will raise this topic with at least two funders before the end of the year.\" \"I will integrate public interest technology into our programs in entrepreneurship and innovation.\" \"We should support public interest project-based learning for undergraduates.\" \"We should create a set of materials for career counseling that highlight jobs in public interest technology.\" \"We should create a fellowship program at the scale of the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships.\" And loan forgiveness, a crucial driver for the success of this new field, was a topic for every attendee.\\n\\nYes, this was just a meeting. But many great movements start with small gatherings, single images, and a great deal of patience. University presidents and provosts know that faculty need to cede some of their That\\'s Not My Field sovereignty in order to serve real student and community needs. The pioneering professors at the conference, my colleagues from across the country, are already doing cross-tech/policy work because they know it\\'s needed. Students are clamoring for just this kind of training and just these kinds of opportunities; the public sector, for its part, needs them to hurry up and graduate. The hope coming from that former horse-ring in Long Island last month is that the time has come for Public Interest Technology to be a \"thing\" nationwide.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"The first thing that hits you, the signal that this drab Michigan office building is a bit cooler than the average, is the smell. The acrid, metallic, plasticky, burning smell, the sort of odor that prompts the question: Is something that is really not supposed to be on fire on fire in here?\\n\\nNo, no, says Dave Bolognino, who heads up General Motors’ design fabrication division. That’s just the byproduct of 3-D printing. In a changing auto industry, this is what innovation (“rapid iteration” in business speak) smells like. And that smell might be wafting to other parts of the company.\\n\\nAbout 30,000 prototype parts get printed each year here at the Warren Tech Center, the sprawling, suburban home to many of the carmaker’s research and development efforts, which hosts over 20,000 GM employees. These parts are fabricated out of at least nine sorts of materials—combinations of plastics and metal and powders—and are used, mostly, for rapid prototyping, for those who want to quickly visualize or understand what a new sort of auto part or configuration would look like. That’s nothing new: GM has been 3D printing prototypes for three decades, starting under the eye of Bolognino’s father John, now retired in his late 70s.\\n\\nToday, specially trained workers run the printing machines six days a week, three shifts a day, a constant churn of popping parts out of molds and watching conglomerates emerge from powders and liquid resins. There’s no real limit to what employees can dream up and print out, says Bolognino, standing in front of a series of shelves filled with grayish mini-bumpers, wheels, and unidentifiable plastic squares cooling just off the printing machines. Though there is a limit on what they will print. A design team once asked for plastic Coke bottle, to use in a model cup holder. “Here’s a dollar fifty,” Bolognino told them. “Go buy one.”\\n\\n3-D printing, aka additive manufacturing, ain’t new at all, but you’ll see it now in more consumer products than ever before. Folks making shoes, dental implants, hearing aids, and even jet engine use printed parts. The Obama administration helped launch the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute back in 2012, a $70 million consortium of businesses and universities dedicated to coming up with new ways to use additive manufacturing to boost American business. The process allows these industries to craft oddly-shaped parts more quickly and with more flexibility than they did in the past.\\n\\nAnd outside GM’s malodorous workshop, 3-D printing is poised to become an even more vital part of the automotive manufacturing process. Carmakers like the Detroit giant are thinking about ways they can fold the process into actual production vehicles, the kind real people drive around every day.\\n\\n“The auto industry has been leading in the use of additive manufacturing for 30 years in the prototyping space,” says Mark Cotteleer, who heads up the consulting firm Deloitte’s Center for Integrated Research and has studied additive manufacturing for last five years. “We’re seeing them start to move into part production in limited ways, primarily at lower volumes.”\\n\\nIn May, GM unveiled its a bid to shoehorn more printing into carmaking. The result is—wait for it—a stainless steel seat bracket. A very, very weird looking seat bracket. Not that any car owners will ever see it.\\n\\nGenerally, building this sort of bracket, which provides a steely, firm base for a car’s seats and seat belt buckles, requires about eight separate parts, purchased from several different automotive suppliers. This new, bizarre one is one continuous component, with each curving tendril serving a specific stabilizing purpose. As a result, it’s 40 percent lighter and 20 percent stronger than the standard, GM says. For automakers who like to entice consumers with promises of faster vehicles with higher gas mileage, this kind of incremental lightweighting is a path to market domination.\\n\\nA worker completes a 3-D printed prototype at General Motors' Warren Tech Center, the automakers' Detroit-area research and development campus. General Motors\\n\\nGM created the seat bracket as a demo project in partnership with Autodesk, the San Francisco design and engineering software firm, which has an engineer constantly embedded with the carmaker’s design team in Michigan. Autodesk’s tech helps the GM designers input parameters—materials, need-to-have elements like holes for screws, cost, object stiffness, mass—to come up with inventive new ways to put parts together. The result is something Salvador Dalí might have dreamed up. Print it off in steel, et voila: a new approach to keeping everybody buckled in.\\n\\nNow, these sorts of seat brackets won’t make it into production cars just yet. The cost of additive manufacturing has come way down in the past few decades, but it’s not yet cheap enough for mass manufacturing. Printing is still too slow for a company that makes more than 8,000 vehicles a day. And integrating the process into the production line is no easy thing. “It’s not about just buying a 3-D printer, says Cotteleer. “For industrial-scale printing, there needs to be a whole digital backbone to send files to where they need to be. And what’s that model going to be?”\\n\\nStil, GM sees great promise in things like wacky seat brackets. “There are 30,000 parts and pieces on each of our vehicles,” says Kevin Quinn, the automaker’s director of additive design and manufacturing. “A realistic change is maybe 100 or 1,000 pieces have a chance to be printed. Five years from now, could that number raise to 5,000? Ten years from now, to 10,000?” The result might be a prettier, more material-efficient, lighter, faster car.\\n\\nIn the meantime, GM says it will also use additive manufacturing to create unique tools used during automotive production, or to customize slick decorative elements for one-off buyers. (Monogrammed grilles, anyone?)\\n\\nOf course, don’t expect entire cars to be printed anytime soon. “This is not a panacea,” says Cotteleer, explaining that a completely 3-D printed car would make no financial sense. But it’s nothing for carmakers to turn their nose up at, either.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'This week, a couple of hundred venture capitalists descended on the Computer History Museum, in Mountain View, California, for Y Combinator\\'s twice-annual Demo Day. The event showcases graduates of the famous incubator\\'s training program to investors who hope to sniff out the next Dropbox, Airbnb, or Stripe, all of which emerged from Y Combinator. But increasingly, the entrepreneurs marching onto the stage are as likely to be experts at manipulating molecules as writing lines of code.\\n\\nFor the first time, one-quarter of the 142 companies that presented in Y Combinator\\'s summer batch belong in the incubator\\'s \"bio\" category, which includes food and agricultural technology as well as all things healthcare. Since 2011, when it made its first bio investments, Y Combinator has steadily increased the number of such companies in its portfolio. The reasons reflect both the popularity of biotech among today\\'s entrepreneurs and the incubator\\'s growing name recognition in health and biology circles, says partner Dalton Caldwell.\\n\\nIn part, new bio companies are capitalizing on past achievements. “We now have enough companies in the ecosystem to build on top of each other,” Caldwell says. A bioreactor startup that Y Combinator incubated last winter helped two current attendees with their manufacturing. The success of another past graduate, Boston-based Ginkgo Bioworks, has raised the incubator’s profile on the East Coast, attracting new applicants.\\n\\nOne company that highlights Y Combinator\\'s growing profile in the Boston-centric biotech sector is 64-x, which launched out of the lab of George Church, the famed Harvard genomicist. It engineers organisms with an entirely new genetic code, for example using amino acids not found in nature. These organisms\\' uniqueness makes them immune to \"every virus on Earth,\" explains cofounder Alexis Rovner. The company\\'s strains promise to help pharmaceutical firms produce drugs more efficiently, among other applications.\\n\\nOther companies focus on building devices to help monitor health at home. A startup called Togg, for example, is building radar sensors for use in nursing homes. In pilot tests, it has installed these slim devices, similar in appearance to a smoke detector, on the ceiling of seniors\\' rooms to monitor their breathing rate, activity levels, and other factors correlated with health. According to George Khasin, a cofounder, the company uses $150 sensors that five years ago cost more than $11,000, a drop driven by the broad usage of radar in new cars.\\n\\nThen there\\'s Higia, a company that offers a $299 bra with thermal sensors that screens its wearers for signs of breast cancer. Its founder, Julian Cantu, is still in his late teens, but he reports that the company sold 5,000 units in pre-orders in three weeks in Mexico. Cantu chose to launch Higia’s bra in Mexico as a regulatory \"hack,\" he says, to collect customers and data while the company navigates the more arduous US Food and Drug Administration approval process. In 2017, the FDA released a note warning consumers that it does not consider this type of screening, called thermography, an adequate replacement for a mammogram.\\n\\nA third device company, Qurasense, is undergoing the clinical trials needed to gain FDA approval, a hurdle not faced by more traditional software companies. Qurasense makes menstrual pads with a built-in blood collection strip that it plans to sell for $25 a month. Pull out the strip, drop it in the mail, and the company says it will share the test results—for HIV status, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and more—in its app. In the wake of Theranos\\'s high-profile collapse, this startup may face greater scrutiny from investors and regulators alike.\\n\\nAcknowledging the unique challenges of startups like Qurasense and Higia, Y Combinator recently brought on Diego Rey, a successful biotech entrepreneur, as a visiting partner. It also urges companies in the incubator to tap a past graduate, a startup called Enzyme, that provides \"FDA compliance as-a-service.\" The incubator\\'s staff is advising its companies to address their regulatory strategy in the roughly two-minute pitches they make on stage, Caldwell says.\\n\\nCompanies in the food sector can also face longer paths to market than pure software companies. Cambridge Glycoscience, for example, is pitching an affordable sugar substitute for use in cooking. \"The drinks industry can make Coke Zero, but the food industry can\\'t yet make Cake Zero,\" cofounder Tom Simmons announced onstage. \"But we did!\" They presented data from taste tests in which participants could not differentiate between their muffins and ones baked with traditional sugar. At the event, their pastry samples were just ok, but it was hard to tell if that was the fault of the sugar substitute, or because the founders\\' baking skills did not yet match their scientific chops.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'If your workspace has seemed a bit shoutier than usual in the last few days, you might have Nicole He to blame. The Brooklyn-based programmer and technologist is the creator of ENHANCE.COMPUTER, an online “cyberpunk game” that recalls the futuristic voice-command sleuth-machines found in films like Blade Runner: By shouting out directives like “MOVE DOWN!,” “MOVE LEFT!,” and especially “ENHANCE!,” you can zoom in on a picture, find a hidden code, and win...well, not much, save for the satisfaction of completely baffling the person sitting next to you. “It’s a game that makes people perform—and people are playing in their offices, in front of their coworkers,” says He, 29. And it’s a totally different game if other people are watching you do it, because, ideally, you have to yell.”\\n\\nA freelance creative technologist at Google Creative Lab, He spent about three weeks putting together ENHANCE.COMPUTER, which was made in collaboration with designer Barron Webster. The set-up is relatively simple: A tiny code is hidden in one of about 50 randomly generated photos; you have one minute to locate the code, which requires you to bark orders to your laptop at an increasingly frantic clip. It’s a tongue-in-cheek realization of two technologies that have been promised to TV and movie viewers for years: Artificial-intelligence systems that understand all of our spoken directives, and the impossibly blur-free zoom-ins that have fueled detective shows like CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. He’s game was intended as an affectionate look at “the reality of this technology as it exists now, as opposed to the techno-utopian ideal,” she says from Melbourne, where ENHANCE.COMPUTER was part of a recent experimental-game exhibition. “I also thought it would be really funny.”\\n\\nMuch of He’s previous work finds her approaching technology with a mix of affectionate skepticism and humor: True Love Tinder Robot, which gauges users’ hand-sweat levels to determine whether to swipe left or right; and Soylent Dick features a faux-phallus (made out of the faux-meal) that ...let’s just say responds whenever users type in a bit of soylent praise. “I’m interested in the ideas like, ‘What is this technology actually doing for us?’ ‘How is it broken?,” she says. “They’re critiques of technology. But at the same time, I’m an optimist who’s loving technology.”\\n\\nHe grew up in Cupertino, California, where the local tech-culture proved to be a huge influence in her decision not to go into tech. “It seemed really boring, like you were just in front of a computer each day,” she says. Instead, she moved to New York City to study journalism, which led to a community-management job at Kickstarter. “I got to meet a lot of creative people doing projects. That’s where I had this feeling of, ‘I want to make some stuff. I just don’t know what it is.’”\\n\\nEventually, she wound up at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, where she worked on projects like Unfamiliar Cat Petting Simulator. And now, He hopes ENHANCE.COMPUTER will remind users that voice-recognition technology is no longer a mere sci-fi trope, and that its applications go beyond Alexa or Siri. “I want people to use it for more stuff,” she says. “These platforms are being used for customer-service chatbot things, but people haven’t done too many really creative things with it.” For now, we’ll have to make do with games like ENHANCE.COMPUTER, which recently received a de facto endorsement from cyberpunk sire William Gibson, who retweeted He’s announcement. That’s one way to make sure awareness of your creation is...ENHANCED.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"As far as plant names go, the sleepy plant—or shy plant, or shameplant, known more formally as Mimosa pudica—is hard to beat. Touch one of its leaves and it curls up like it’s embarrassed, the leaflets folding in on each other. It’s hypnotic and, well, kind of a surprising response for an organism without a brain.\\n\\nNow, the shameplant is getting its very own robotic doppelganger. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have developed deceptively simple actuators (the fancy term for a motor that moves a robot) made of conductive 3-D printed material and paper. Apply electricity to the inked material and it shapeshifts, producing smooth movements. It’s not the burliest actuator by any means, but paper actuators could well carve out their own niche in robotics.\\n\\nVideo by Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\nThe trick is something called a polylactide, a kind of thermoplastic that provides shape memory. This is combined with graphene, which carries current, to make 3-D printed “ink.” After the printer lays down the ink on a piece of paper, the researchers pop it in an oven at 160 degrees Fahrenheit. When they pull it out, they bend it to the default shape they want the material to “remember” when the paper is at rest.\\n\\nTake a look at the GIF below of a paper gripper. When the researchers apply electricity, it produces heat, which activates the thermoplastic and softens it. With the thermoplastic now more malleable, the natural stiffness of the paper flattens everything out. So the fingers straighten a bit when current is applied, then return to a more curved default shape when the thermoplastic cools and hardens, thereby gripping the object. Without a heat source, it goes back to the default. “It basically becomes stiffer and pulls the paper substrate up again due to its shape memory effect,” says robot designer Lining Yao, who helped develop the system.\\n\\nVideo by Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\nThe researchers could also modify the system to respond to human touch. A finger will change the capacitance of the circuit, which a microcontroller detects. With a touch-sensitive actuator like this, the mechaplant can fold in on itself if disturbed, just like the real thing out in nature. The team also built a lamp that turns on with touch and changes shape as its vertical paper supports morph.\\n\\nThe return to the default shape, though, doesn’t happen particularly quickly. Once the electrical heat source is removed, the thermoplastic has to air-cool to stiffen up and assume the set shape. So maybe down the line, instead of a 3-D printed “ink” of thermoplastic, it could be more porous. “You can imagine if it's porous, the air can get in and out much faster,” says Yao.\\n\\nVideo by Carnegie Mellon University\\n\\nAnother downside, of course, is that paper isn’t the strongest of materials. It also has a pesky habit of catching on fire, which probably means paper actuators won’t have much of a role in, say, manufacturing robots.\\n\\nBut for kid or pet-friendly robots? Just maybe. So-called “soft” robots like this new paper system may be weaker, but they’re much better at getting along with humans. And they’re super cheap—helpful in any situation that prioritizes disposability.\\n\\nA bigger issue is the very nature of heat. “It is a really simple method—joule heating leads to thermal expansion—and uses inexpensive controls and materials, but it is incredibly inefficient,” says mechanical engineer Nicholas Kellaris, who studies actuators but who wasn’t involved in this paper. The electricity you start with is high grade energy, but heat? Not so much.\\n\\n“Since these paper actuators presented in the paper are not strong, I think their promise lies in art and interactive design with morphing structures,” says Kellaris. Like making mechaplants that are ashamed of themselves, for instance. If that’s not a promising future, I don’t know what is.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " \"Scientists in the US may be out in front developing the next generation of Crispr-based genetic tools, but it’s China that’s pushing those techniques toward human therapies the fastest. Chinese researchers were the first to Crispr monkeys, and non-viable embryos, and to stick Crispr’d cells into a real live human. And now, a team of scientists in China have used a cutting-edge Crispr technique, known as base editing, to repair a disease-causing mutation in viable human embryos.\\n\\nPublished last week in the journal Molecular Therapy, and reported first by Stat, the study represents significant progress over previous attempts to remodel the DNA of human embryos. That’s in part because the editing worked so well, and in part because that editing took place in embryos created by a standard in-vitro fertilization technique.\\n\\nSo-called “germline editing,” the contentious technology that can permanently change the code in every cell in the human body, has been gaining acceptance in the last few years as research has pushed forward, illuminating the possibilities of Crispr. Immediately following those first reports of embryonic gene-editing in China in 2015, an international summit convened by the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that actually trying to produce a human pregnancy from such modified germlines was “irresponsible,” given ongoing safety concerns and lack of societal consensus. Two years later, a report from the NAS and the National Academy of Medicine stated that clinical trials for editing out heritable diseases could be permitted in the future, but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight.\\n\\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Crispr\\n\\nAttitudes may be slowly changing: Last month, the United Kingdom’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics went so far as to say that heritable genome editing could be “ethically acceptable in some circumstances.” A Pew Research Council study released at the end of July found that 72 percent of Americans think changing an unborn baby’s DNA to treat a serious disease would be an appropriate use of gene-editing technology.\\n\\nIn the study published in Molecular Therapy, the Chinese scientists corrected a mutation that causes Marfan syndrome, an incurable connective tissue disorder that affects about 1 in 5,000 people. A single letter mistake in the gene for FBN1, which codes for the fibrillin protein, can cause a ripple effect of problems—from loose joints to weak vision to life-threatening tears in the heart’s walls. Starting with healthy eggs and sperm donated by a Marfan syndrome patient, the team of researchers from Shanghai Tech University and Guangzhou Medical University used an IVF technique to make viable human embryos. Then they injected the embryos with a Crispr construct known as a base editor, which swaps out a single DNA nucleotide for another—in this case, removing an “A” and replacing it with a “G”. They kept the embryos alive for another two days in the lab, long enough to run tests to see how well the editing worked.\\n\\nSequencing revealed that all 18 embryos had been edited, with 16 of the embryos bearing only the corrected version of the FBN1 gene. In two of the embryos, additional unwanted edits had also taken place. Previously, the most successful demonstration of gene editing in the human germline was the correction of a mutation that causes a hereditary heart condition in 42 out of 58 embryos. That study, which was published last year, used standard Crispr cut-and-paste technology.\\n\\n“It’s a nice demonstration of the use of base editors to correct a well-known point mutation that causes a human genetic disease in a setting that may become therapeutically relevant,” says David Liu, whose lab at Harvard developed the base editor used to correct the Marfan mutation, though he was not involved in the study.\\n\\nRather than breaking the double-stranded DNA molecule and allowing the cell to repair itself with a healthy gene template, these newer versions of Crispr change just a single letter. If Crispr is a pair of molecular scissors, Liu’s base editors are more like a pencil with a squeaky new eraser. While the hope is that such precise gene-writing implements won’t cause the kind of sloppy chaos that Crispr 1.0 is capable of, Liu says it’s too early to make any general statements about their relative risks as a therapeutic. “Despite more than 50 publications using base editors from laboratories around the world, the entire field of base editing is only about two years old, and additional studies are needed to assess as many possible consequences of base editing as can be reasonably detected.”\\n\\nSome of those studies are being conducted at Beam Therapeutics, the startup that Liu co-founded earlier this year with fellow Crispr pioneer Feng Zhang. Beam’s first license agreement with Harvard covers Liu’s C base editor, which makes programmable C-to-T or G-to-A edits. The second is the A base editor, which can do T-to-C as well as A-to-G edits, like the one used to correct the Marfan mutation. But don’t expect Beam to be erasing genetic diseases from the germline any time soon. The company is focused on using base editing to treat serious diseases in children and adults only, not on embryo editing, says CEO John Evans. “More consideration would be needed before society is ready to consider embryo editing, and we look forward to participating in the discussion.”\\n\\nIn the meantime, Beam will be just one of many US companies looking at an increasingly streamlined path for genetic medicines. In July, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced a new regulatory framework for gene therapies to treat rare diseases. The agency issued a suite of six guidance documents updating the approval process. And on August 17, the FDA along with the National Institutes of Health proposed changes in the way the agencies together assess the safety of gene-therapy human trials.\\n\\nSpecifically, the proposals will eliminate review by the NIH’s Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, which was established in 1974 to advise on emerging genetic technologies. In a New England Journal of Medicine editorial describing the changes, Gottlieb and NIH Director Francis Collins wrote it was their view that “there is no longer sufficient evidence to claim that the risks of gene therapy are entirely unique and unpredictable—or that the field still requires special oversight that falls outside our existing framework for ensuring safety.” A more streamlined approval process may help the US move faster in the long-run, though probably not enough to catch China’s head start. But when it comes to gene editing's most controversial applications, there’s nothing wrong with being slow.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'Early Tuesday, Microsoft announced that last week it seized control of six domains owned by the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also known as APT28. The hackers had used the sites to mount midterm election-related phishing campaigns, similar to those Fancy Bear launched during the 2016 United States election season. It\\'s the most prominent, publicly known effort to proactively identify and thwart Russian election hacking efforts—and Microsoft\\'s in a unique position to pull it off.\\n\\nThe newly announced takedowns were just the latest from Microsoft\\'s Digital Crimes Unit, which had previously disclosed that it blocked phishing attempts against three congressional campaigns. While Russia\\'s political hacking in the US has mostly appeared to target Democrats, Microsoft pointed out that this time many of the phishing sites—which impersonated think tanks and some Senate pages—targeted Republican groups that have criticized President Donald Trump\\'s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nWith the midterms just three months away, Microsoft aggressively detected and and disabled Fancy Bear phishing sites to deflate the group\\'s efforts. \"We have now used this approach 12 times in two years to shut down 84 fake websites associated with this group,\" wrote Microsoft president Brad Smith. \"Despite last week’s steps, we are concerned by the continued activity targeting these and other sites and directed toward elected officials, politicians, political groups and think tanks across the political spectrum in the United States.\"\\n\\nSend It To the Sinkhole\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s ability to pull off these preemptive strikes stems less from technological innovation than from a lawsuit the company brought against Fancy Bear in 2016, first reported by The Daily Beast. Because Fancy Bear phishing efforts mimic and blend into Microsoft services, the court granted the company standing to take legal action, which not only allowed for its 2016 suit, but also laid the groundwork for Microsoft to seek court approvals as needed to take down malicious sites.\\n\\n\\'It\\'s not a gimmick, but it\\'s also not an innovation.\\' David Kennedy, Binary Defense Systems\\n\\nSpecifically, Microsoft has used a technique known as sinkholing, a way to divert network traffic from its planned destination to a different server. Microsoft combines its broad visibility into its billions of users, and the chops of its internal Digital Crimes Unit, to get a jump on phishing sites like the ones Fancy Bear established, get legal permission to take over those domains, and then send any traffic that heads their way to oblivion instead.\\n\\n\"It’s not a gimmick, but it’s also not an innovation,\" says David Kennedy, CEO of the threat tracking firm Binary Defense Systems, who formerly worked at the NSA and with the Marine Corps\\' signal intelligence unit. \"Sinkholes are used to seize malicious domains in order to protect. It\\'s a very common practice and used all around the security industry.\"\\n\\nIn this case, it\\'s an especially useful technique. The Fancy Bear sites Microsoft hunts down are designed to look like familiar, legitimate political portals for campaigns, lobbying groups, think tanks, and more. A phishing attack lures people who work for or with those organizations into entering the login credentials and other information they would normally use on the legitimate versions of those sites. When Microsoft observes this type of activity—through tracking Fancy Bear\\'s movements across the web, or flagging indicators like telltale patterns in user data—the company investigates, and begins considering a takedown.\\n\\nOnce it makes that call, Microsoft would have a range of options. The company hasn\\'t shared specifics, and did not respond to a request by press time, but many sinkholes route traffic by altering the Domain Name System registry—basically the internet\\'s phone book lookup—so the domain you want to sinkhole redirects to your own server instead. Microsoft could either take Fancy Bear sites down in one fell swoop, or gain domain control quietly, and conduct some reconnaissance before delivering the final blow.\\n\\nStanding Out\\n\\nOther tech companies like Level 3, now owned by CenturyLink, and Palo Alto Networks have used sinkholes to take down botnets, mostly related to digital crime syndicates. But many mainstream tech firms that would be well-positioned to do similar work, like Google, have been quieter about these types of initiatives. Google does send warnings to Gmail users when it sees evidence that state-sponsored hackers may be trying to phish certain accounts. The company said on Monday that it just sent a new batch of thousands of warnings, though not timed to any specific attack.\\n\\n\\'Microsoft has an entire specialized team whose job it has been to do this for many years.\\' Dave Aitel, Cyxtera\\n\\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has focused on takedowns for years. \"Microsoft Security has a history of working sinkhole operations,\" says Jake Williams, a former NSA analyst and the founder of Rendition Infosec. \"They do a ton of threat research.\" Collaborating with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, the company has used sinkholing to neuter botnets and more. As with Fancy Bear, the company has experimented before with laying legal groundwork first.\\n\\n\"Microsoft has an entire specialized team whose job it has been to do this for many years, working closely with US law enforcement,\" says Dave Aitel, a former NSA researcher who is now chief security technology officer at the secure infrastructure firm Cyxtera. \"The interesting thing in the recent reports has been the direct attribution to Russia. It may be that we are witnessing a norm being changed with regards to how far private companies will go against nation states.\"\\n\\nThreat intelligence firms typically shy away from saying with certainty that they know who perpetrated a particular digital attack, or what their motives are. It often takes months or years for attribution to emerge publicly. But Microsoft has been definitive so far in pinning the phishing sites on Fancy Bear.\\n\\n\"Microsoft coming out publicly and saying who it is—that\\'s not what we typically see from them,\" Binary Defense Systems\\'s Kennedy says. \"Attribution isn’t an easy thing, it requires a lot of time and investment in tracing the actors. But there’s a concerted effort across public and private groups in finding out what Russia is doing and outing them, because they are our most active adversary.\"\\n\\nThough sinkholing is a popular and reliable defense tool that can neuter malicious sites, it can\\'t stop adversaries from endlessly launching new ones and attempting to better conceal them. As a result, motivated and well-resourced attackers who are beyond law enforcement\\'s reach will forge ahead, evolving and innovating to continue their attacks in new ways. Microsoft\\'s takedown efforts alone can\\'t resolve the threat of Russian election meddling. But it can certainly slow hackers, down and potentially make their attacks less effective.\\n\\n\"We don\\'t have a lot of arrows in the quiver in terms of cyberpolicy, so Microsoft is filling a gap here,\" Cyxtera\\'s Aitel says. \"It would be great if we could deter this behavior in another way, but for now this is what we have.\"\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",

As for the future of FiftyThree’s suite of apps, including Paper, which has 25 million users, the company says the apps will live on with “increased investment and support.”\\n\\nWIRED spoke to FiftyThree cofounder and CEO Georg Petschnigg about why he sold FiftyThree, the biggest changes he’s observed in the app economy over the past several years, and why he and his team ignored the words of Steve Jobs and made a stylus anyway. The interview has been condensed for length.\\n\\nWIRED: Talk about why you sold FiftyThree. How long have you been in acquisition talks for?\\n\\nGeorg Petschnigg: We’d been in each other’s orbits for a long time, because Troy Carter and Suzy Ryoo are shared investors and advisors. But then the conversations started in earnest a few months after we launched Paste, our team collaboration product [in November 2017].\\n\\nI went on a very, very long walk with Gordon [Willoughby], their CEO, in New York. We walked from first the East Side to West Side, and then the West Side all the way over DUMBO. We crossed Manhattan several times. Then a few days later, I met with cofounding shareholder Damian [Bradfield] in London. And it was very clear that this was meant to happen.\\n\\nThey have this unique business model where they’re able to offer a free, ad-supported version and a subscription version, and what’s unique about their free version is they do this by respecting people’s privacy and their data. And at the same time we were looking at expanding our Paste app on the desktop, and that’s where WeTransfer has a very strong business and a much more active user base.\\n\\nWIRED: Had you been talking to any other companies about acquisition?\\n\\nGP: Over the last seven years? Oh, jeez. (Laughs.) There have been various talks in different forms and different phases. But the thing that has always given us the most joy is figuring out how to put technology in service for creativity, and it turns out there are a lot of people who say they provide those services, and a lot of people who truly believe in it and do it every day. We felt that was the case here.\\n\\nWIRED: Let’s go back to the beginning when you first started FiftyThree. What was your goal then, and how did that reflect what apps and the App Store were like at that point in time time?\\n\\nGP: When you look at the founding team at FiftyThree, we came from two very different parts of Microsoft. One hand was working on productivity tools—Word, Powerpoint, Excel—essentially making people more efficient, squeezing more performance out of the brain. And the other hand you had folks from Xbox and a lot of entertainment products, ensuring that people went back to their leisure time. And somehow, you’re sort of wasting people’s time on one hand, and on the other hand you’re making them a better, faster cog in the machine. Something about the human experience was lost between those two.\\n\\n\\'it wasn’t until Cambridge Analytica that I would say consumers really started becoming more aware of what is happening when you use free software.\\' Georg Petschnigg, FiftyThree\\n\\nAnd then when iPad launched, it wasn’t clear what iPad was going to be for. Maybe it was going to be the next-generation magazine, with publishers creating new magazine formats. Maybe it was going to be the next big video service. People really didn’t know. When we looked at it, we clearly saw the iPad for creativity. That lead to the Paper app, where you could take the ideas in your head and quickly translate them via your fingertips into ink strokes. It really changed people’s perception of the iPad, but for us, it also put FiftyThree on the map.\\n\\nThe next step for us then, which really started in 2012, was to think through the stylus as a tool. That ended up leading to the development of Pencil.\\n\\nWIRED: What strikes me is that it sounds like you’re saying that transition to hardware was a pretty natural thing. But at the same time hardware is really hard, especially in the startup world if you don’t have the supply chain or product management expertise. So what was it that made you say, let’s make hardware?\\n\\nGP: Yes, hardware is hard but when you look at our founding hardware team...I mean John Ikeda was part of the development team that created the original Xbox 360 controller; our head of engineering led engineering at Sonos; our product manager who was running the program ran the supply chain for Sonos as well. So in a way, yes, hardware is hard and I absolutely wouldn’t do that if you didn’t have a great network and team. But in our case, many people at FiftyThree had reached levels in their careers where they were comfortable with it. So it wasn’t, ‘Can we build the product?’ but instead, ‘Are we building the right product?’\\n\\nWIRED: How many Pencils did you sell? Was it profitable for FiftyThree?\\n\\nGP: Oh yeah. This was also the very unusual part: It was a profitable hardware program. I don’t think we ever disclosed how many we sold.\\n\\nWIRED: So what’s interesting is that your app Paper was, from the beginning, considered to be an Apple darling. And then Apple came out with something called...Pencil. What was that moment like for you and your team?\\n\\nGP: That was...We…(long pause)...Look, when we were out starting FiftyThree in 2011, I can’t tell you the number of people who told us that proverbial Steve Jobs story about styluses. People would just tell me over and over again, ‘A stylus is bad; don’t do it.’\\n\\nWhat our team really believed is that we had to develop new technology that allowed us to move creativity forward on devices. Today, when you look at the stylus landscape, it’s clear what a deep impact Pencil—in particular the design of Pencil—had. Stylii today are buttonless, they have a fine tip to write, they have a side to shade, they emphasize expressiveness and creation. The design language of that was created through Pencil. [Writer’s note: FiftyThree discontinued its hardware business at the end of 2016.]\\n\\nFiftyThree\\n\\nWIRED: Your software also evolved along with the App Store. At first your app was free; that was maybe part of the assumption then, during App 1.0, that things would be free. And then you started offering something more advanced as a subscription, which seems like it was hitting this curve of app makers trying to monetize what they were doing and not in spammy, gross ways. So talk a little bit about that evolution of software.\\n\\nGP: When we first launched Paper with in-app purchases, that was phenomenal. As someone coming from the world of shrink-wrapped software sales, very large software sales, the idea that you could sell an in-app purchase or productivity tool and only sell as much software as people needed was hugely appealing. That worked very well initially. The only challenge is that you quickly realize that the first version of your software is the cheapest to develop. Software, especially that’s used by millions of people, the support and ongoing maintenance is way more expensive than the initial development.\\n\\nWhat muddled the picture over the years, though, is actually the introduction of free software that is financed by the sale of data. And it wasn’t until Cambridge Analytica that I would say consumers really started becoming more aware of what is happening when you use free software. Like, something is truly being sold. You are being targeted. And that’s happening because people are selling interpretations or analyses on top of your data. And it’s not just Facebook. But that did lead to somewhat of a warped price perspective on how much software ought to cost.\\n\\nSo when Apple started that shift to software subscriptions, it was a really important and very big shift. But the consumer understanding of, ‘How many subscriptions should I have?’, or ‘Why should I buy a subscription?’ and ‘How does that work?’ I think that will take a few more years for it to really take hold.\\n\\nWIRED: Would you say that subscriptions have been successful for you?\\n\\nGP: Yes, they have been.\\n\\nWIRED: So one of the things I’m hearing you say is Paper is a profitable program, Pencil was profitable for you...is FiftyThree profitable at this point in time?\\n\\nGP: Well, FiftyThree as a company no longer exists, but, WeTransfer is a profitable company. FiftyThree was not profitable at the time of the acquisition.1\\n\\nWIRED: Why sell?\\n\\nGP: In our case it’s because we wanted to be part of a larger offering, and from a brand and culture perspective, and a business perspective, it was a great fit.\\n\\nWIRED: What would you say has been the biggest change you’ve seen in the app economy over the past seven years?\\n\\nGP: There have been so many things. One thing is, iPad Pro and the introduction of Apple Pencil has transformed that computing experience.\\n\\nThere’s also that channel fatigue and people not wanting to install new apps, and I think people are having a much more mature and healthy relationship, or at least, the beginnings of a much more healthy relationship with technology where we’re all realizing how much it can distract you. I don’t think it’s surprising that the most successful applications right now are meditation applications.\\n\\nAlso, our relationship with data is changing. The business economics around subscription models are still forming.\\n\\nAnother thing that’s changed is that people have become such great photographers. To me that’s kind of incredible. Where we are today, looking at the visual fluency people have, and how they’ve gotten there through technology, that’s been an incredible shift. So yeah, seven years of working through and around the App Store, it’s been quite the journey.\\n\\nWIRED: So the first thing you mentioned just now is iPad Pro and the introduction of Pencil. I’m just so curious as to how your team reacted to that. Did Apple call and say, ‘Hey, we’re making a Pencil!’ I mean really, what’s the story behind that?\\n\\nGP: What I can tell you right now is that it had a material effect on our business. But not a materially positive effect, let’s put it that way.\\n\\n1Correction: An earlier version of this article quoted Petschnigg as saying, \"We transferred as a profitable company.\" The correct statement is, \"WeTransfer is a profitable company.\"\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",

       " 'Sennheiser’s new HD 820 headphones solve the one imperfection of the German company’s coveted HD 800s. See, the previous model has an open-back design, which gooses the audio but lets ambient noise leak in—and all of Bowie’s histrionic sighs leak out. This year, Sennheiser put a lid on the 800s. Two lids, actually: The high-definition dynamic drivers in the HD 820s are covered with curved Gorilla Glass panels. The caps’ concave design reflects errant sound waves into a resonance-abating absorber to keep the audio crisp. The music retains the detail found in the open design, minus the pesky leakage. In an elegant touch, the clear glass leaves the intricate, shiny transducers visible, like the rear crystal on a mechanical Swiss watch. Über-phones like these require a dedicated amplifier; pair them with Sennheiser’s HDV 820 amp (another $2,400) to hear “Ashes to Ashes” like never before.\\n\\n$2,400\\n\\nBuy Now\\n\\nStyling by Reina Takahashi\\n\\nThis article appears in the August issue.

       " 'This year, Fitbit finally figured out how to make a smartwatch people really like, while sales of its lightweight activity trackers have been on the decline. But that’s not stopping the company from putting out new activity tracking wristbands. It just announced its newest device: the Fitbit Charge 3.\\n\\nAt first glance, the Charge 3 looks simply like a new take on an old tracker. It has the same wristband form factor, the same unremarkable display as previous Charges, which historically have been Fitbit\\'s most popular product. It even has the same price as the Charge 2 did when it launched: $149.95 for the standard model, and $169.95 for a “special edition” model that comes with Fitbit Pay and an extra black classic band. But the Charge 3\\'s build, guts, and software features have changed enough to warrant serious consideration if you’ve been thinking about updating your Fitbit.\\n\\nFitbit\\n\\nThe display on the Charge 3 is nearly 40 percent bigger than the display on the Charge 2. It\\'s the first in the Charge lineup to have a touchscreen. Sure, the black display still has an oddly-large bezel you can see if you peer closely enough at it, and Fitbit still feels compelled to have the word “Fitbit” written on the face of its products. But this is a Fitbit, not an Hermès watch.\\n\\nThe module is now made of space-grade aluminum instead of stainless steel and plastic. There’s an inverted, inductive button on the side rather than a mechanical button. Press your finger on it, and the Charge 3 will give haptic feedback. On the tracker’s underside, you’ll find an updated heart-rate sensing module—the same one that’s in the Fitbit Versa, which includes an SpO2 sensor to measure oxygen saturation. (Since this is a consumer device, it isn’t a substitute for medical equipment, but it can give an approximation.) The SpO2 sensor also plays a role in Fitbit’s grand plans for future health tracking.\\n\\nAs with previous Charge products, there’s no built-in GPS sensors for measuring distance while running and cycling. But this also boosts the battery life. For the Charge 3, that translates to a claim of up to seven days on a single charge. It also comes with yet another proprietary charger, which had to be redesigned to accommodate the Charge 3’s new heart rate module.\\n\\nThanks to its larger screen and upgraded processor, Fitbit has crammed smartwatch-like interactions into the Charge 3: You can swipe up to see your daily dashboard, swipe down to see notifications from smartphone, swipe left to go through workout options and apps, and so on.\\n\\nLike many Fitbits before it, the Charge 3 will track a whole bunch of health metrics and workout activities: steps, distance traveled, calories burned, stairs climbed, walking, running, cycling, yoga, elliptical, strength training. One new feature: It’s water-resistant up to 50 meters, so there’s a new swim mode on the device. It also auto-pauses if you stop at a stoplight (or stop because you’re winded, like I do) during a run.\\n\\nFitbit says it has improved its heart rate algorithms “in the order of 10 to 20 percent in running and cycling conditions,” according to Conor Heneghan, the company’s lead research scientist.1 (In the past, consumers have filed suit against Fitbit for what they claimed was inaccurate heart rate tracking by a significant margin.) And now Fitbit is attempting to correlate more insights for people; it might tell wearers, for example, that their heart rate data suggested they were particularly stressed one week, and so they might want to try Fitbit’s “Relax” app.\\n\\nFinally, Fitbit is launching a beta version of something it\\'s calling \"Sleep Score.\" It\\'s a score that will be assigned to wearers each day as an overall assessment of their sleep quality, but will also include information on sleep disruptions, the company says. This isn\\'t limited to Charge 3; it will roll out to any Fitbit with newer heart rate sensors.\\n\\nThis is a Fitbit, not an Hermès watch.\\n\\nFitbit is loading on the features at a time when competition is only getting stiffer in wearable land. And by pre-announcing a wearable that isn’t shipping until October, Fitbit seems anxious to get the Charge 3 out there ahead of whatever wearable Apple might show off next month. Samsung also just announced a new flagship smartwatch, the $350 Galaxy Watch.\\n\\nDespite Fitbit’s brand recognition, its concerns about Apple Watch are well-founded, since the company ceded the top spot to Apple last year in wearables. For a corporations like Apple or Xiaomi, wearable devices are just a part of their overall strategy; for Fitbit, it’s the entire business. Fitbit co-founder and chief executive James Park insists there’s still room for growth in both lightweight activity trackers and smartwatches, and that if you were to look at a Venn diagram of the two types of consumers, there’s some overlap there (people who might consider both). He may be right. But right now, Fitbit isn’t selling enough in either category to beat out its competitors.\\n\\nFitbit’s efforts around more advanced health-tracking have been slow going too, although those are potentially some of the more interesting features that the company’s R&D team is working on. Last year it said was coming up with a solution for tracking sleep apnea through its more advanced wrist wearables—including the new Charge 3, which has the newer heart rate sensors. It also said it was working with glucose monitor maker Dexcom to develop an app that could help people with diabetes keep track of their glucose.\\n\\n“When you look at the killer app for these devices, it’s health,” says Park. “And people’s interest in their health and well-being is only going to increase over time. So I think we have to deliver devices, and more importantly, algorithms and software, that make it relevant for people.”\\n\\nThe Dexcom app and sleep apnea tracking product haven’t launched yet, though, and Fitbit would need FDA approval before it attached any kind of official medical claims to its devices. Park said that the company is working separately with the FDA on a regulated product for advanced sleep tracking, but didn’t have a timeline yet for when that would launch. “We see things like this as check engine light or a seat belt for your health,” Park said. “Something that, one day, you wouldn’t want to leave your house without. And I think the addressable market for these types of devices is huge.”\\n\\nThat’s a big “if” for Fitbit. But if it gets there, it sure would be a huge leap—or many steps—beyond basic activity trackers.\\n\\n1Correction: An earlier version of this article attributed a quote to Dennis Hsu, Fitbit\\'s director of product marketing. The story has been updated to say that it was Conor Heneghan, Fitbit\\'s lead research scientist, who made the statement about heart rate tracking improvements.',\n",
       " 'If you were watching MTV in 1990, you might remember seeing Madonna, draped in an American flag, bopping around between snapping backup dancers, and encouraging viewers to vote in that year\\'s midterm elections. It was the first-ever ad for Rock the Vote, the youth-focused voter engagement group that has partnered with MTV in splashy, celeb-studded campaigns ever since.\\n\\nFast forward nearly three decades, and MTV is still striving to turn out the next generation of voters. Now, however, the network is hoping to deploy an even mightier tool than Madonna in the 90s: FOMO in 2018.\\n\\nAt the Video Music Awards Monday, MTV will premiere +1TheVote, a new digital initiative aimed at getting young people to convince their friends to register to vote with them. The site allows users to search their friends by name or upload their entire contact lists to see who is and isn\\'t already registered. Then, it prompts them to reach out to those friends on Facebook Messenger, Twitter, or email with made-for-meme messages like, \"When you find out your friend isn’t registered to vote, but they’re at every march... ☕\" and \"👏We 👏 should 👏 vote 👏 together 👏 - it takes 2 minutes to register. Do it right now: plus1thevote.com.\"\\n\\nThe goal, according to MTV president Chris McCarthy, is to capitalize on this generation\\'s instinct to share every facet of their lives. \"They\\'re the most connected generation ever,\" McCarthy says. \"Why not launch something that really harnesses the most powerful forces in their lives?\"\\n\\nIronically, it\\'s those same forces—the generational shift toward social platforms—that weakened MTV\\'s standing as the primary cultural hub for American youth over the last decade. As YouTube stars and Instagram influencers became pop culture\\'s new tastemakers, it appeared for a while that the more than 30-year-old network had outgrown the audience it once commanded. Then, in 2016, McCarthy took the helm and gave MTV a much-needed makeover, reviving beloved unscripted series like Jersey Shore and doubling down on programming designed for social media. Now, the network is on track for its fifth-straight quarter of ratings growth among 18- to 34-year-olds.\\n\\n\\'They\\'re the most connected generation ever. Why not launch something that really harnesses the most powerful forces in their lives?\\' Chris McCarthy, MTV\\n\\nFor McCarthy, the midterms are coming at just the right time. \"It feels right to do this is in a time when we’re in a resurgence,\" he says of the voter registration initiative. MTV\\'s changing fortunes also happened to overlap with what McCarthy calls an \"awakening\" in political activism among young people, catalyzed by the shooting in Parkland, Florida earlier this year, which drove students into the streets in record numbers during the March For Our Lives. In June of this year, MTV\\'s own polling found that 46 percent of 15- to 34-year-olds said they believe they can make a difference in government, up from just 37 percent in March.\\n\\n\"They see themselves in the marches and in the walkouts,\" McCarthy says. \"They\\'re really seeing an impact.\"\\n\\nAnd yet, young people remain a frustratingly difficult voting block to move, particularly during midterm elections. According to the Census Bureau, in 2014, just 23 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds voted. \"There’s an incredibly low turnout in midterm elections. That point cannot be overemphasized,\" says Kei Kawashima-Ginsberg, director of a group at Tufts University called CIRCLE, which researches youth voting habits and is partnering with MTV on +1TheVote. CIRCLE\\'s research also suggests that young voters have even less trust in political institutions than older voters.\\n\\nBut what does motivate young voters, according to CIRCLE’s research, is peer pressure. “It’s really friends they trust the most, and there are very few other things they trust,” Kawashima-Ginsberg says. “The power of the peer combined with accountability and pressure is important.”\\n\\nThat motivator isn’t just limited to young people. One 2012 Yale University study found a higher turnout among voters who received mailers promising to share their turnout history with their households and their neighbors. Facebook, meanwhile, participated in a massive study during the 2010 midterms involving 61 million users. Some were shown a message reminding them to vote, while others got the same message, only with photos of their friends who had clicked the “I Voted” button attached. That study, published in 2012, found that voters who got the message with their friends’ photos were .4 percent more likely to vote compared to the other group and a control group, who received no message at all. That may sound like a negligible boost, but the researchers said it was significant, translating to an estimated 340,000 additional votes.\\n\\nIn 2012, President Obama\\'s campaign invested heavily in this sort of outreach, building a tool that strategically told Obama supporters which of their Facebook friends they should, for instance, encourage to vote.\\n\\nThis body of research convinced MTV to maximize social pressure heading into the midterms. In addition to the online tool, MTV will be sponsoring parties at polling stations with the group #VoteTogether in November. The Ford Foundation, The Alliance for Youth Organizing, and a startup called TurboVote are also partners. (Rock the Vote is not.)\\n\\n+1TheVote is still a work in progress. For starters, MTV\\'s tool can\\'t scrape a user\\'s social media profile to search for friends who aren\\'t registered, unlike the Obama campaign\\'s tool. Facebook cut off that capability for new apps in 2014 to protect user data. That means +1TheVote users need to either manually enter their friends\\' names and cities, or upload contact lists from their email providers. On top of that, the tool does not yet have an integration with Gmail, the most popular email client, though MTV says it is currently working on one.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen whether MTV still has enough cache to move young voters—or whether anyone can. But if +1TheVote does succeed in registering young voters and increasing their turnout, it\\'s likely the Democrats will benefit more than Republicans. While +1TheVote is non-partisan, younger voters have traditionally leaned left. So does MTV\\'s programming. During last year\\'s VMA\\'s, host Katy Perry introduced the best new artist category calling it the “election where the popular vote actually matters.” In March, the network went dark to support the national school walkouts protesting gun violence. Even dating shows like Are You the One? have revealed partisan inclinations recently. During this season\\'s premiere, one cast member\\'s support for President Trump earns him boos from the rest of his house mates and poses a threat to a blossoming romance.\\n\\nMcCarthy says all this is merely a reflection of its audience, a younger generation that is increasingly multicultural and passionate about issues of equality. \"When it comes to gender equality, when it comes to racial equality, LGBT equality, those are table stakes for this generation. That\\'s the way they believe the world should be,\" he says. \"We agree with them.\"\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"In 2015, German-born photographer Katrin Korfmann was living in China; her husband, sculptor Jens Pfeifer, was doing a three-month artist’s residency there. One day, Pfeifer gave Korfmann a tour of the factory that was fabricating some of his sculptures. As soon as they saw the crowded factory floor and its dozens of artisans performing their various alchemical tasks, the couple1 knew they had the subject for her next series.\\n\\n“In Western society, we often have this idea of the solitary artist in his or her studio, getting inspiration,” Korfmann explains. “It’s a very Romantic ideal of the artist. But there’s also a lot of hard work involved, often physical work. Sometimes the artist has an idea, and then the work gets produced in a factory that has nothing to do with the idea.” Rather than focus on the finished work of art, she and Pfeifer decided to highlight everything that happens behind the scenes to make that art possible.\\n\\nThus began three years of travel that took them around the world: a marble production company in Carrara, Italy; a ballet rehearsal in Amsterdam; an 11th-century tannery in Morocco; a glass factory Anxi, China. At each location, they mounted a camera on a 20-foot-high tripod and, over the course of several hours, took hundreds of photos of the workspace—a process Korfmann likens to “scanning” the location with her camera.\\n\\nBack in the studio, Korfmann and Pfeifer then digitally stitched together the photos to create a single, bird’s-eye view of the various fabrication processes, a technique that took her and her assistants anywhere from a week to a month. Rather than capturing an exact facsimile of the space, the process allowed the photographer to combine all the various facets of artistic production—time-lapse photography collapsed into a single image.\\n\\n“What you see in the final image isn’t a documentary truth,” Korfmann says. “It’s more of an interpretation of the spot. It’s an assemblage of hundreds of images.” (An exhibition of the images, which Korfmann produced with Pfeifer, will open at Los Angeles’s Kopeikin Gallery on November 11.)\\n\\nAn alternative way to capture such a wide array of action in a single shot would have been to use a fish-eye lens, Korfmann says, but that would have distorted the edges of the image. Only by painstakingly assembling dozens of discrete high-resolution images could she create a final image with such remarkable clarity. Many of the photographs show dozens of people, each of whom Korfmann shot individually and then combined into a single master shot. But Korfmann rejects the idea that using such digital legerdemain is somehow “cheating.”\\n\\n“Even if you take one picture, you choose the moment of reality,” she points out. “From the moment you exclude something from reality, you’re giving an interpretation. What I do is really just an extension of that.”\\n\\n1 Correction appended, 8/21/2018, 2:02 pm EDT: This story was changed to make clear that Korfmann and Pfeifer collaborated on the project equally, rather than Korfmann producing with Pfeifer's assistance.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",

The spacecraft, which launched in 1997 and died by diving into Saturn’s atmosphere last year, spent more than a decade doting over the ringed planet. In this, one of the most spectacular photos ever taken by Cassini, you can see the planet peeking through the gaps in its glorious rings. Cassini got the shot in April 2007, from 450,000 miles above Saturn’s surface.\\n\\nEver wondered what a partial solar eclipse looks like—from space? Last week on August 11, while only parts of Asia, North America, and Northern Europe could see the moon slide between Earth and the Sun, the partial solar eclipse was quite the show for the European Space Agency’s Proba-2 satellite. These images, showing the beginning and end of the eclipse, were taken about two hours apart.\\n\\nIt’s easy to forget about the International Space Station, orbiting above our heads at 17,000 miles per hour and going all the way around Earth every 90 minutes. The station isn’t just a football-sized science laboratory, but a way to help the world’s countries achieve their #SpaceGoals. Here we see three small satellites called cubesats as they drift away from the ISS to start their orbits around Earth. One of them is for the Kingdom of Bhutan, and it’s the nation’s first-ever satellite. The foreground features one of the station’s solar panels, with the thin, blue haze of Earth’s atmosphere in the back.\\n\\nJupiter as watercolor: This is what the biggest planet in our solar system looks like, close up. The gas giant’s Great Red Spot bleeds in at upper left, with its swirling tan and white hues creating an illusion of artistic layers. NASA’s Juno spacecraft captured this image in April this year during its 12th orbit around the planet. Astronomers pore over these pictures to better understand Jupiter’s complex atmosphere—and that research is being tapped by scientists studying other atmospheres too, including our own.\\n\\nHere’s how the Hubble Space Telescope sees NGC 2108, a star cluster first discovered in 1835 by astronomer John Herschel. Note the bright, red point of light in the lower left of the cluster: That’s what’s called a carbon star. It has an atmosphere mostly made up of carbon monoxide and other carbon compounds, unlike our Sun, which is mostly hydrogen and helium. That composition scatters the blue light emanating from the star, allowing the red to shine through.',\n",
       " 'Speed has tripped the light fantastic in America for more than 85 years. From Ritalin and Adderall to the twice-methylated Breaking Bad stuff, speed seduces both overbright founders and scurvy garage-dwellers. But it’s not the drug for right now. Speed is not only deadly; it’s defeatist.\\n\\nIt’s been two sobering years. We’d do well to take stock of what we were blind to in the raciest days of Silicon Valley and the government-as-usual Obama years. When the writer Casey Schwartz gave up Adderall after having it define her youth, she identified deep regrets: “I had spent years of my life in a state of false intensity, always wondering if I should be somewhere else, working harder, achieving more.” America is plenty intense—and it requires more freethinking from its citizens now than ever. It’s time for a reckoning with reality, reflection and reform, principled action. It’s also a time for civil disobedience. As grandiose as Adderall makes some people feel, the history of amphetamine as a drug of subjugation—used to compel obedience in soldiers, dieters, and unruly kids—haunts it.\\n\\nIn 1933, 46 years after Lazăr Edeleanu, a Romanian chemist, fatefully synthesized amphetamine—a mix of mirror-image molecules, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine—Smith, Kline & French picked it up and sold it as Benzedrine. Wouldn’t you know, enterprising hacker-tweakers soon prised open the inhalers, liberated the speed-soaked cotton strips, and swallowed them.\\n\\nBenzedrine as an “alertness aid” then shipped out to war. Months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the drug was, quite literally, weaponized. Military commanders, writes Nicolas Rasmussen in On Speed: From Benzedrine to Adderall, greatly feared another humiliating epidemic of “shell shock” like the one that had crippled the Allied armies of World War I. To keep soldiers looking on the bright side of war, armies began provisioning the men with amphetamines. Psychiatrists on the battlefield rechristened shell shock “operational fatigue,” and soldiers were relieved to hear they had a manly sounding physical ailment, eminently treatable with more Benzedrine. Get back out there, Private.\\n\\nCombat itself was changed by speed. Speedfreak servicemen of the 1940s made for gung-ho, wild-eyed fighters as the drug supplied them with fool’s courage. They hurled themselves into battle where they might otherwise have been held back by less thrilling but more adaptive human traits: anxiety, prudence, conscience. Commanders liked what they saw, and kept their men dosed.\\n\\nWhen the soldiers came home, many were addicted, and their wives were the nation’s next good soldiers. They reproduced the logic of the battlefields: They sucked down amphetamines to wage war on bodies—their own. The postwar obsession with thinness developed in tandem with the speed trade. By the end of the ’60s, 9.7 million Americans used prescription amphetamines. Of those, hundreds of thousands were addicted. The everyday tweakers jittered along, subduing their fears and hungers with the pep pills that were now dyed and looked like candy.\\n\\nIn 1968, after speed killed a dieting woman, an investigative journalist for Life magazine, Susanna McBee, published a bombshell exposé about the overprescription of pills for weight loss. McBee made a tour of doctors’ offices, and—after cursory interviews—was able to cop bags and bags of darling little tablets. Of course McBee had no weight to lose. But the drug trade now battened on the styling of female flesh as a disease.\\n\\nFrom soldiers to dieters to children. After McBee’s article, and more deaths traced to diet pills, weight-loss speed became more tightly regulated. But speed changed shape. Just as “operational fatigue” and “flesh” had been styled as pathologies, distractibility got a pharmaworld makeover—and became ADHD. Ritalin prescriptions for kids took off in the 1990s. By 2011, 3.5 million children in the US were on stimulants. A recent formulation, Adzenys, is aimed at first graders and up: It’s orange-\\xadflavored and melts in your mouth.\\n\\nSpeed can give kids a wonderful A-student experience. Of course parents want their kids to have that. To know the pleasures of conformity is a kind of bliss; those who pretend otherwise must never have feared that their eccentricities would disqualify them from life. But eventually the wandering mind, the hunger, and the anxiety return.\\n\\nSpeed gooses certain receptors to fake a body out, making it feel tight, urgent, self-important. On speed, you tend to embrace monotonous chores, especially asocial or servile ones, like arid sessions of dusting or coding, as the tiny muscles that line the walls of blood vessels contract. Speed also curbs mucus, while relaxing the lungs. So while users have symptoms of fear that may read as excitement, they also breathe easier.\\n\\nYou’d do well to lay off the starch and read some Betty Friedan on the slavery of scut work.\\n\\nEventually, though, congestion returns. The mortal coil tightens. When it does, you may wonder: Why am I taking apart iPads and starching sheets? Good question, and you’d do well to lay off the starch and read some Betty Friedan on the slavery of scut work. Also, sleep. But if speed calls you back, it’s because the power to rise to social demands that elude undrugged brains—that just feels too good.\\n\\nIt’s not immoral to want relief from being too slow, scared, and fat—too disappointing to your commanders. But chasing relief with speed could set you up for brain damage and psychosis. Worse, under the guise of fraud liberation, it locks you into life-\\xaddraining repetition. You think you’re being gloriously “productive”—even if what you’re producing is expense reports and Fortnite kills—without noticing that you’re missing the reasons for being: food, books, reflection, reform, engagement, adventure, rest, and meaningful work.\\n\\nWhy would anyone submit to this? Years ago, I stumbled upon an illustration of meth’s effects in Donna Tartt’s The Little Friend. Danny takes a hit and “Tears rose to his eyes. The icy, disinfectant taste at the back of his throat made him feel clean: everything surface again, everything sparkle on the glossy face of these waters which swept like thunder over a cesspool he was sick to death of: poverty, grease and rot.”\\n\\nI tried Ritalin in graduate school. I did manage term-\\xadpaper all-nighters under its influence, and stopped eating; I had the sense that people like bosses were pleased with undernourished, industrious me, that I was doing well by them. But the tensing of blood-vessel muscles evidently reads to my body not as euphoria but as a kind of stifled misery, and sometimes I’d mistake my loss of appetite for grief. More precisely: High on speed, I felt as though someone I loved dearly had recently died. Worse still, I felt too important and prolific to mourn, or even care.\\n\\nVirginia Heffernan (@page88) is a regular contributor to WIRED.

       " 'Defense Distributed, an Austin-based company notorious for 3-D printing a gun, recently won its risky landmark case against the federal government, allowing it to host digital gun designs on the internet. Though a federal judge blocked the ruling with a temporary injunction earlier this month, if the company’s legal strategy holds, it verges on mad genius. The reasoning: If a well-accepted First Amendment protects bits in the form of speech and code, and a contested Second Amendment protects atoms in the form of guns, then by turning guns into code (ie, atoms into bits) we get First Amendment protection for guns too.\\n\\nAntonio García Martínez (@antoniogm) is an Ideas contributor for WIRED. Previously he worked on Facebook’s early monetization team, where he headed its targeting efforts. His 2016 memoir, Chaos Monkeys, was a New York Times best seller and NPR Best Book of the Year.\\n\\nThis Defense Distributed story—with its confusing twists into First Amendment jurisprudence, computer-controlled manufacturing, and 3-D printing (and more on that in a moment)—cannot be fully understood without understanding the past half-century in firearms innovation. This new technology is completely undermining the way we’ve traditional regulated guns, and will overturn our nation’s longstanding political compromise around them.\\n\\nBut first, what is a gun exactly?\\n\\nThe revolver above is my grandfather’s Smith and Wesson .38 Police Special (inherited), once the standard police sidearm. It’s a forged hunk of metal, and close to nothing on it can be modified without serious gunsmithing—and, even then, it’ll never be more than a medium-frame, six-shot revolver.\\n\\nRed - gun. Green - not gun Antonio Garcia-Martinez\\n\\nLet’s fast-forward to the present.\\n\\nThis is a disassembled AR15. It is modular in every way, and every bit of it can be swapped out like so many Legos. Whatever your opinions on gun control, the AR15 is a masterpiece of open source, modular design—by changing out a part for one with a similar function but different design, both military and civilian owners can endlessly modify it into almost anything, from a submachine gun to a sniper rifle.\\n\\nRed - gun. Green - not gun Antonio Garcia-Martinez\\n\\nYou might ask: If the modern military weapon is just Legos, then what part is the “gun,” the specific piece of hardware with unique rules around sales and ownership that makes it different from, say, a chainsaw or blender?\\n\\nThe federal bureaucrat responds: The “gun” is the thing with the serial numbers on it. In the case of AR-pattern rifles, that’s what’s known as the lower receiver (or just “lower”). It’s the lower part that encases the rifle’s action, where the pistol grip attaches and a magazine goes in.\\n\\nEverything else is an accessory, even though it actually does the work of a gun, namely loading a cartridge into the action, striking the primer, which ignites the gunpowder, launching the projectile and hot gasses out of the barrel, and, finally, getting ready to do so again.\\n\\nThis is the official “gun” part of an AR. Everything else is really, truly, not considered a “gun.”\\n\\nThe decision to anoint the lower receiver a gun is a momentous bureaucratic decision. It means that everything in the “non-gun” category, which is most of the actual gun, can be bought and sold unrestricted online, like so many shoes on Zappos. Right now, you can buy everything in the “non-gun” category with zero checks online.\\n\\nParticularly in light of the initial discussion around advanced manufacturing, you might ask: If the “gun” is this relatively small piece of metal or polymer, then why can’t I make it myself somehow?\\n\\nLet’s answer that via a thought experiment:\\n\\nSay I took a rectangular hunk of aluminum and machined out a hole like the magazine well of the AR.\\n\\nThen I machined out the trigger opening.\\n\\nThen I machined out the base where the pistol grip attaches and every other detail in the “gun” part (see graphic).\\n\\nAt what point did the hunk of metal become a “gun”?\\n\\nThis isn’t mere philosophizing. It’s a real issue in gun regulation. The federal bureaucrat responds again: That piece of aluminum became the “gun” when you got 81 percent of the way to finishing it. After that point, it must be bought and sold as a gun, with all the restrictions that apply.\\n\\nWhat does the enormous US market in gun parts do? It sells you an 80 percent finished piece of metal, which is officially not a “gun” (though it really looks like one) on the internet, no questions asked (link provided for reference, not an endorsement). This is known in the gun world as an “80 percent lower.”\\n\\nThe aspiring unregistered gun owner then finishes the last 20 percent at home, with a drill press and/or a milling machine. Combined with the “non-gun” parts bought freely online, they now have a fully functioning AR15. Nobody knows that gun exists, and it is completely untraceable.\\n\\nSome retailers (such as the one linked above) offer you the entire package: every non-gun piece required and an 80 percent finished “gun” (again, really just the lower receiver), plus they’ll even include some machining jigs to make the finishing easier. This is the IKEA model of firearms, which even has its own IKEA Effect: New gun owners feel disproportionately attached to a gun they “made,” even though really they just put it together, often with the same hex keys you’d use on an IKEA bookshelf. Anyone with a credit card and address can buy this, and nobody on the planet is the wiser, save the retailer, who is not required to report anything, since they’re just selling “accessories.”\\n\\nThe entire gun debate is really about that last 20 percent of the bureaucratic “gun,” and how and where it happens. This is where Defense Distributed really comes in. They sell you a gadget that makes that last 20 percent step easier than doing it yourself, via a computer-controlled milling technology that’s been around forever. It isn’t a fundamentally new gun technology, but it is an important last-mile advance.\\n\\nI mention 3-D printing nowhere. That’s because it’s irrelevant, and most of what you read about 3-D-printed guns is noise. 3-D printing is a relatively immature manufacturing technology, and it won’t be making a modern, repeating firearm any time soon. (At least not the home 3-D printers that are cheaply available.) The only reason 3-D printing is even in the story is because Defense Distributed, geniuses at marketing, created a toy 3-D-printed product that could fire one round (before maybe exploding in your hand) as a way to plant the meme in the heads of people (and politicians) who know nothing about guns.\\n\\nSo why is everyone freaking out, including the attorneys general of several states that are suing Defense Distributed to stop? First, they are misunderstanding the technology, and believing Star Trek replicator fantasies around 3-D printing and guns. Second, and more seriously, advances in gun modularity and manufacturing now make most gun regulation obsolete.\\n\\nTo understand why technologies like those of Defense Distributed are poised to make gun regulation obsolete, we have to understand how gun regulation historically worked. In states like California and New York that wish to limit access to dangerous weapons, regulation has focused on certain features associated with military-style firearms, like pistol grips, quick-release magazines, folding stocks, and so on. In a world where guns were largely static and hard to modify, and the existence of such features indicated whether they were destined for sporting or military use, this approach made sense.\\n\\nWith this new modularity of firearms, this has essentially already happened. Consider the .50 Barrett M107 sniper rifle. You may have seen the weapon in 2010’s Academy Award for Best Picture winner, The Hurt Locker, where it’s used by US soldiers to eliminate Iraqi snipers from an astonishing distance. It fires a projectile the size of your thumb, and can kill a man from over a mile away. In spirit, the weapon is illegal in California. In actual fact, it’s legal with the right modifications that only slightly impact functionality. Gun regulation fails.\\n\\nWhy does this odd status quo exist?\\n\\nOur current gun laws are a necessary compromise among pro- and anti-gun extremes, plus a large middle that wants some gun control but not an outright ban. The NRA zealot is placated by Democratic rhetoric around banning only “weapons of war” paired with the technical knowledge that they can tolerably dodge most Blue State gun laws via the modular technology described above. The pro-gun-control Blue Staters are placated because politicians are “doing something,” and thanks mostly to ignorance about how modern guns work, think their gun laws are actually stopping the distribution of firearms when they increasingly resemble security theater.\\n\\nDefense Distributed’s ultimate goal is to kick the final, weak leg out from under this tenuous political agreement, and force a reckoning with the state of firearms technology. When the last-mile problem of untraceable, unregistered guns has finally been “solved,” even politicians can’t maintain the charade of effective gun control.\\n\\nWhether Defense Distributed manages to spark the conflict now or advancing technology eventually sparks it later, this country will come to a total impasse on guns in which the existing compromise becomes untenable. What then?\\n\\nFoundational ideological conflicts in this country have always been resolved by one side co-opting some feature of the federal government (for example, the US Army, the Supreme Court, ICE) to force the other side to accept its interpretation of the Constitution. Depending on the party in power, both Democrats and Republicans have attempted just that, such as by tightening gun laws via the Federal Assault Weapons Ban signed by Bill Clinton or, more recently, through failed attempts by House Republicans to expand concealed-carry rights nationally.\\n\\nAlternatively, faced with this and other divergent opinions on key issues like abortion and immigration, the union reverts to a pre–Civil War level of federalism, where the US becomes a loose association of states, and every state goes off their own constitutional interpretation. In that scenario, the Blue States pursue the gun-banning strategy, turning themselves into a US version of Canada. Their pro-gun residents will rail online about “From my cold, dead hands!” and then quietly move elsewhere (to some extent, this is already happening). The pro-gun states will maintain their pro-gun stance, whatever the gun violence rates may be.\\n\\nIt’ll be weird and inconsistent, but we’ll prefer this new awkward compromise to the alternatives: “Calexit,” another Civil War, or the dissolution of the 242-year-old experiment in democracy we call the United States of America.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"In a café on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, a one-time videogame developer turned political theorist named Santiago Siri is trying to explain to me how his nonprofit startup, Democracy.Earth, aims to fix the world’s broken politics with the help of the blockchain. The conversation has already covered a dizzying amount of ground. We’ve discussed the emergence of the Westphalian order of nation-states in the 17th century, Russia’s interference in the 2016 US election, the total collapse of Venezuelan society, and Siri’s own experience of political corruption in his native Argentina. But he finally boils it all down to one short sentence. “We want to tokenize the like,” Siri says. At the center of the project is the creation of what he calls “political cryptocurrency”—blockchain-generated tokens that users of Democracy.Earth’s software can spend as votes. Siri grew up in Argentina, where he saw the effects of corruption on democracy first hand. Sasha Arutyunova The way Siri sees it, we have traded in the original liberating potential of the internet for sterile corporate serfdom. Our time spent online retweeting and upvoting and clicking on emojis serves mainly to help unaccountable corporations like Facebook, Google, and Twitter to better target us with advertising. Siri dreams of a new kind of social media platform on which we spend “vote tokens” that can do anything, from electing politicians and passing referendums to enacting the bylaws of a social club or establishing the business plan of a corporation. It’s democracy by click. The vision is a radical departure from the one-person, one-vote, once-every-year-or-two trip to the ballot box we are familiar with—and by which, in Siri’s view, we are so ill-served. Users of Democracy.Earth’s one-size-fits-all governance platform—code-named Sovereign—would have infinite flexibility to vote on any kind of topic or person, whenever they log on. In the Democracy.Earth future, every day will be election day, and the ballot will include anything that enough of us think should be there. In this perfect world, Siri argues, the supposedly unhackable and absolutely transparent blockchain will ensure that no centralized election authority is required to tabulate a vote, and no corrupt politician or gridlocked legislature can interfere with the popular mandate. But coming up with a superior form of voting technology is just the beginning; the larger, far more revolutionary goal is to devise a decentralized decisionmaking process that eliminates the necessity for any kind of central government at all. “We are not in the business of selling e-voting machines or helping modernize governments with internet voting,” Siri says. “We want to empower people down to the individual level without asking for the permission of governments.” If the dream of bitcoin, the token generated by Satoshi Nakamoto’s blockchain, was to free money from central bank control, then the dream of Sovereign is to free politics from central government control. Siri’s complicated, multilayered solution to democratic dysfunction raises a host of questions and paradoxes. There is no shortage of secure-voting-systems experts who believe that radical blockchain democracy could cause more problems than it solves, and is in fact an invitation to gaming and manipulation at odds with the idea of transparent, fraud-free voting. Still others question how Democracy.Earth plans to solve the gnarliest quandaries faced by any voting system: How does one simultaneously ensure transparency in the voting process while guaranteeing the anonymity of the voter? How can one enfranchise direct voting without running the risk of a feckless tyranny of the majority motivated by short-term passions making terrible decisions? But nothing raises more eyebrows than the jewel in Democracy.Earth’s crown: the vote token. Because—like bitcoin, like Ether, and like so many of the cryptocurrency tokens sold by blockchain startups in initial coin offerings, known as ICOs, to fund their own operations—the Democracy.Earth vote token has a financial value. According to Siri, early in 2018 Democracy.Earth raised $1.5 million in a vote-token “presale.” It has plans to mint “a maximum” of 500 million tokens, provisionally priced at 12 cents each, for a company valuation of $60 million. Democracy.Earth employees will be compensated for their labor with tokens. The bottom line: There will be a financial market for the mechanism that Democracy.Earth users employ to vote. And that’s a headscratcher. “Ask yourself,” says Joseph Kiniry, CEO of Free & Fair, a company that provides secure election services, “if combining the idea of an ICO and democratic elections sounds fishy or not.”\\n\\nThe Trojan horse that rolled through Buenos Aires in 2013 was designed, like its ancient Greek forebear, to catch the unsuspecting eye. Towed down the streets by a car, 20 feet high and exquisitely carpentered, it caused an immediate sensation. Kids ran alongside. An excited crowd gathered when it came to a halt in front of the Palace of the Argentina National Congress, the political heart of the South American country. Argentina's Partido de la Red—Party of the Internet—used a flamboyant Trojan horse to symbolize its entrance into the nation's politics. Courtesy of Santiago Siri The publicity stunt aimed to spread awareness of an upstart new force in Argentinan politics, the Partido de la Red. “Until then, we were just the guys from Twitter, the nerds, playing politics,” says Siri, a cofounder of the party. “But then everyone was like, ‘What the hell is that?’ People started taking selfies. It became a symbol of the campaign.” Partido de la Red means “Party of the Net”—as in, the internet. It was founded to represent the interests of an emerging generation of millennial, always-online activists thoroughly dissatisfied with decades of Argentina’s endemic political corruption and spectacular financial crises. Its affiliation with the internet was meant to signal faith in a new kind of collaborative democracy. One of its primary goals was to elect politicians who would commit to uphold decisions made by party members in open, online debates. No more closed-door maneuvering. No more voting according to who delivered the most cash. “We had one rule,” Siri says. “Obey the internet.” The Trojan Horse’s symbolism ran deep. Like the original equine that carried hidden Greek warriors into the city of Troy, it represented the idea that the Partido de la Red would sneak its way into the established order and wage war from the inside. But it was also a play on the computer world’s co-optation of the name. This party was a computer virus designed to breach the security of Argentinian politics. At first, things seemed to be going well. In its first attempt to contest an election, the party captured 1.2 percent of the national vote, considerably better, Siri says, than the 0.2 to 0.3 percent a new party usually gets. “We had a lot of followers online,” Siri says. “It became a movement. We got into the game.” “And then,” Siri says, “things started to get really strange.” Provocateurs began showing up at party meetings. Siri’s car tires were slashed. A shadowy character told him that a “donation” of a million pesos to a federal judge would magically solve his party’s registration problems. He discovered that “changing the system from within was not going to happen,” Siri says. “The system was going to change you first.” So instead of trying to infiltrate the old system, Siri decided to build an entirely new one. He started putting together his blockchain governance platform. In January 2015, he made his way to Mountain View, California, where he had 10 minutes to impress Sam Altman, president of legendary startup incubator Y Combinator. It wasn’t going well. Siri remembers being “super nervous.” When Altman asked him a question about how many users the fledgling enterprise might eventually have, “I invented a number out of thin air.” The 10-minute window was closing fast. Then he showed Altman Instagram pictures of the Trojan horse. “They were like, ‘What!? What did you do!?,’” Siri says with a smile. “They loved us.”\\n\\nDemocracy.Earth’s white paper, “The Social Smart Contract,” is a tract that is equal parts crypto-libertarian manifesto and a technology road map for Sovereign. When stripped of its rhetoric (“The internet is incompatible with the nation-state,” “Representative democracies are an accident of the information technologies of the 18th century”), it breaks down into half a dozen major pieces. In addition to the blockchain and vote tokens, there is also a flexible ruleset for voting called “liquid democracy,” a complicated system for identity validation involving video selfies and “attention mining,” and even a version of a universal basic income scheme that will regularly “drip” new vote tokens into the accounts of Sovereign users. Fully explicating the potential and pitfalls of any single element of Democracy.Earth’s technology requires a lengthy journey into mostly unmapped territory. Consider, just for starters, the concept of “liquid democracy”—an approach to voting that is radically different from Western democratic electoral systems. In Sovereign’s scheme, users are allocated a stockpile of votes they can use (or spend) in a variety of ways. Siri approaches politics with the mindset of an engineer, meticulously tracking his ideas in notebooks. Sasha Arutyunova They can vote more than once on a particular topic, to express a heavier “weight” of intent. They can delegate their votes on a topic to trusted experts who are expected to understand the issue at hand in greater depth. They can even change their votes or retract their votes after the fact, if they change their minds on a subject or if they believe an elected representative has failed to deliver on their promises. Log on to the beta version of vote.democracy.earth for the first time, and you start off with 1,000 votes to do with as you please. A scroll of questions, action items, and ongoing debates occupies the center of the screen. Should there be a second Brexit vote? Should Venezuelan opposition leaders maintain dialogue with the repressive Maduro government? Do you think a universal basic income should be granted unconditionally? Liquid democracy is an always-on mashup between direct democracy and representative democracy. Voters are simultaneously constituents of multiple overlapping organizations: local, international, aspirational. In Siri’s imagination, dipping into liquid democracy’s never-ending flow will fit as naturally into the lives of the smartphone generation as checking Twitter or Instagram. Moritz Ritter, managing director of Berlin-based advocacy group Liquid Democracy, which is unaffiliated with Democracy.Earth but has been pushing similar ideas about how elections can be reimagined for years, says the purpose is “to take the current system of representative democracy and make it more responsive and distribute power more equally. In our view, this is necessary, because we see a growing disconnect between political actors and citizens manifested by shrinking numbers of members in political parties, dramatically shrinking voter turnout in elections, and growing mistrust of political systems.” “Democracy.Earth,” Ritter says, “is a really thorough approach for rethinking online voting and allocating political power without centralized institutions.” As described by Ritter, it’s easy to see the appeal of liquid democracy for a constituency dissatisfied with politics as currently practiced. But it may be a mistake to try to map what Democracy.Earth is doing directly to our current status quo. Whenever I asked Siri how exactly his technology would affect something like the emergence of Donald Trump in US politics or the authoritarianism of President Maduro in Venezuela or, in perhaps the most formidably dismaying scenario, the total power of the Chinese Communist Party, Siri would change the grounds of discussion away from the political exigencies of the moment and toward the contemplation of more ethereal, long-range goals. The internet and the blockchain, he believes, have smashed the old nation-state era to dust. In this new, profoundly globalized, borderless, and increasingly decentralized universe, we are no longer defined by our geographical location in a particular territory. Instead, we are citizens of the world, and in the future we will require the evolution of new, decentralized organizations aligned with the constraints of our new reality. Democracy.Earth, I gradually came to understand, is an ongoing research laboratory and thought experiment in how to design decisionmaking mechanisms appropriate to this new world. “Our aim is to provide a token that can be trusted for governance because of the legitimacy we can bring in regarding identity validation and liquid democracy rules,” Siri says. “I think we are discovering the building blocks for creating purely digital institutions—institutions that never need to go through a bureaucracy or a bank or a state in order to exist.”\\n\\nThe proposition that new solutions are necessary for our strange new world is hard to argue against. The problem lies in proving that something as complex as Democracy.Earth fixes more than it breaks. Consider the most fundamental piece of Sovereign’s infrastructure, the blockchain. The case for the application of the blockchain to voting systems is that blockchains are supposed to be perfectly transparent scorekeepers that can’t be hacked by Russian bots or bought off by Super PAC fund-raising or corrupt Argentine politicos. The immutability of a “distributed ledger” shared on multiple computers is an article of faith in the crypto community. Using Sovereign, Siri says, voters will be able to track their votes on the blockchain; they will know without any doubt that their vote was cast and counted as intended. Herb Stephens, a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur who serves as Democracy.Earth’s treasurer, says the goal is a system in which “everyone has a copy and everyone can monitor the things that matter to the public in general.” Or, as the white paper puts it, “with a blockchain-based democracy votes become censorship-resistant and every single voter can audit an election without requiring any kind of access rights to infrastructure.” Experts in secure voting systems disagree. “It is a terrible mismatch for the voting and election space,” says Josh Benaloh, a senior cryptographer at Microsoft Research who has spent 30 years researching secure voting systems. “It seems attractive, until you scratch under the surface. There are so many ways in which blockchains don’t solve the real problems, they just make everything worse.” Dan Wallach, a professor specializing in computer security at Rice University, believes that the crypto-infatuated generation is far too optimistic about what their new toys can achieve. “Blockchain people haven’t really been paying attention to the threat models inherent in voting, particularly bribery and coercion,” Wallach says. “They tend to make naive assumptions about voters’ ability to control the cryptographic keys and software used to express their votes. None of these systems are suitable for use in real-world municipal elections.” Wallach and Benaloh both reiterated the classic “garbage in, garbage out” problem that has long afflicted computer programming. Certainly, once things are recorded on the blockchain it is very hard to change them. (As Harper Reed, Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign chief technology officer, told me, “the blockchain is great for knowing whether people are messing with your stuff.”) But Benaloh is worried about vulnerabilities that occur before data is encoded in the blockchain. There could be malware on your smartphone that alters your vote as soon as you try to spend your token. Even worse, there could be an agent of a repressive state with a gun to your head dictating exactly how you vote. Or, your vote could just get bought—something that some researchers think will be even easier on the blockchain than at the old-school ballot box. Although Democracy.Earth intends for Sovereign to ultimately be “blockchain-agnostic”—that is, it should be compatible with a multitude of different public and private blockchains—right now it is being designed to take advantage of the “smart contract” capabilities built into the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts automatically execute transactions on the blockchain when certain conditions written into the blockchain’s code are met. Sovereign’s vote tokens, therefore, can automatically trigger smart contracts. For example, an organization debating whether to spend funds on a particular project holds a vote; if a majority spends their tokens voting yes, the funds are instantly released. But in a system where the decisionmaking entity—the vote token—is itself something bearing a financial value, the potential for smart-contract mayhem is enormous, says Ari Juels, a Cornell Tech computer scientist who studies blockchains and smart contracts. In early July, Juels coauthored a blog post pointing out that smart contracts could be equally as effective at “buying elections” as they would be properly executing the results of an election. “The Democracy.Earth scheme offers a clear and simple illustration of the type of attack we’re concerned about,” Juels writes in an email. “Very simply, someone can anonymously launch a smart contract that buys people’s votes by purchasing their Democracy.Earth voting tokens. The broader point is that the very transparency of blockchains can be a liability in elections, as it exposes the choices of voters. Smart contracts can automate vote buying, guarantee payment, and otherwise undermine election integrity. The white paper suggests that the connection between identities and cast votes might be broken using new techniques. But breaking this connection when a voter wants it in place in order to sell her vote is hard.” “I hold the same opinion as the rest of the international experts in crypto and elections,” says Kiniri of Free & Fair.1 “There are nearly only ‘cons’ to using blockchain technology in the voting process.”\\n\\nThe son of a corporate lawyer and slipper company entrepreneur, Siri grew up in Buenos Aires, idolizing both Steve Jobs and Che Guevara. Before getting involved in Argentinian politics, he carved out a successful niche as a videogame designer, launching two game companies as well as cofounding a game developer association. He dreamed, he tells me, of building a game like SimCity, “only with actual citizens.” He jumped on the blockchain bandwagon early, although he notes, just a tad ruefully, “I wish I bought more.” “But I bought enough,” he concludes. Santiago Siri photographed in New York City in August 2018. Sasha Arutyunova As far as his own politics are concerned, Siri says that he’s been “introduced in different places around the world as either a revolutionary leftist or a Davos-man entrepreneur engaging in politics. Both are flattering to me.” There’s no question he’s hard to put in a box. Every conversation I had with Siri was a roller-coaster: Game theory, the quantum nature of reality, the failure of the Bolshevik revolution, the internet’s responsibility for the polarization of our current information ecology—in real time, you can feel Siri restlessly trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together. He’s a big thinker, tackling problems that are as big as they get. But the more we delved into the nitty-gritty of Democracy.Earth’s technology, the more difficult it became to evaluate its objective merits. When I pointed Siri toward Juel’s blog post about smart-contract vote-buying and shared Benaloh’s critique of the blockchain as applied to real-world elections, his answers took me further into the labyrinth. “Of course there are all kinds of concerns as we expand our understanding of how to architect systems built only with information,” he wrote via email. “We are aware of the diverse set of attacks that can happen. But voting isn’t a uni-dimensional problem. It’s just the name we give to transactions happening within the wider realm of governance. Elections, as we understand them under the traditional sense on how they’ve been held by the nation-state, are probably not the fittest form of governance to be delivered in digital form ... That’s why intrinsically understanding how blockchains can scale social consensus is definitely the way to go.” What Siri seemed to be saying is that Sovereign isn’t really intended as a replacement for how the United States elects a president or California passes an initiative. Instead, it's really an exercise in figuring out how to use the blockchain to make group decisions in the crypto-digital domain. Sovereign, in other words, represents government of the crypto-people, by the crypto-people, and for the crypto-people. Ultimately, maybe, the crypto-people will soon just be the people. But we’re not there yet. Underlying everything in the Democracy.Earth platform, and more generally in the whole crypto-libertarian project to remake society into a decentralized utopia free of coercion and exploitation, is a near-evangelical faith in the premise that computer code can solve the messy realities of human life. “The interesting thing about crypto,” Siri says, “is that you can start creating institutional models that no longer rely on the fallibility of human authority but are strictly based on code, mathematics, and encryption; you can start building an institutional reality where the checks and balances are protected by hard promises, by fundamental mathematical constructs that are simply impossible to break due to the intrinsic properties of how information works.” This is a difficult argument to challenge by picking away at potential smart contract vulnerabilities, or any other objective critique of the blockchain as it exists now, because the answer to every problem is a new technological solution that just hasn’t been discovered yet. And it’s an impossible argument to challenge by pointing out such things as the possibility that a centralized database with really strong security provisions is probably a more efficient way to run an election than by using the blockchain, when the whole point of the project is to avoid having a central authority in the first place.\\n\\nA primitive version of Sovereign was tested during the 2016 Colombian referendum held to approve a peace treaty between the government and the FARC rebels. One thousand expatriate Colombians who were unable to register to vote in the actual election took part. In a preliminary stab at implementing the flexibility of liquid democracy, the trial group was given the opportunity to cast a symbolic vote on seven different propositions relating to the peace accord, rather than just a binary yes/no on whether to pass the accord. Siri says the approach helped explain the surprise real-world defeat of the accord, because the Sovereign-using voters approved six of the peace-related proposals, while overwhelmingly rejecting a proposal to allow FARC to participate in government. As an experiment in how voting could be conducted with more nuance than conventional models, the FARC referendum is interesting. But it still falls short as proof of how a full-fledged Sovereign exercise of vote-token fueled liquid democracy might work, because too many pieces of the puzzle still remain in development. Most critically, there has been, to date, no real-world test of the use of Sovereign’s blockchain generated vote tokens. And that is precisely where the whole Democracy.Earth experiment is most provocative. The main reason voting-technology researchers cast a leery eye on the merger of cryptocurrency and voting stems directly from the example of bitcoin, which evolved from means of exchange to speculative commodity. Instead of being used to actually buy things, bitcoin has turned into the digital equivalent of gold—a way to get rich by simply buying and selling when the price is right. So what’s to stop “owners” of vote tokens from buying and selling them as commodities instead of using them to vote? Siri and Stephens both acknowledge that the potential for vote-token speculation is a real concern. At the very moment I was posing them the question in early July, the entire Democracy.Earth team held a one-week retreat to figure out how to guard against exactly such a scenario. After the retreat was over, Siri sent me a preliminary draft of their new “token economics” white paper. Along with another dollop of rhetoric—“we consider token-based liquid democracies to be the most flexible form of democratic governance that can be constructed with digital technology”—the paper made a pledge that Sovereign’s vote tokens would be built with incentives designed to keep token prices stable. Like many elements of the Democracy.Earth technology roadmap (and this is a common aspect of ICO white papers) the goal sounded more aspirational than grounded in executable code. But two different academic cryptocurrency researchers with whom I discussed the plan said they were hard put to figure out why a vote token had to have monetary value in the first place. One suggested that the primary motivation was likely “business reasons”—that is, funding ongoing operations or, more simply, profit. Even worse, to participate in this form of voting, you have to be able to afford the vote token in the first place. Someone has to cover the cost of computation on a public blockchain. In the world of old school politics, “paying to play” is generally frowned upon. Perhaps in theory Democracy.Earth’s outline of a universal basic income scheme could address that issue, but that’s also another example of adding complexity to an already Rube Goldbergian contraption. Siri’s rejoinder is that there has to be some real skin in the game to make online voting meaningful. “The purpose of using a blockchain is for decisions that aim to be immutable, and hence able to trigger cryptocurrency transactions or execute smart contracts,” Siri says. “Our aim is to evolve the experience using social media into something that is effectively able to push institutional change with transactions that are backed by economic drivers brought in by the users themselves.” In other words, paying to play is a good thing.\",\n",

       " \"One day in the summer of 1969, a young Marine lieutenant named Bob Mueller arrived in Hawaii for a rendezvous with his wife, Ann. She was flying in from the East Coast with the couple’s infant daughter, Cynthia, a child Mueller had never met. Mueller had taken a plane from Vietnam. After nine months at war, he was finally due for a few short days of R&R outside the battle zone. Mueller had seen intense combat since he last said goodbye to his wife. He’d received the Bronze Star with a distinction for valor for his actions in one battle, and he’d been airlifted out of the jungle during another firefight after being shot in the thigh. He and Ann had spoken only twice since he’d left for South Vietnam. Despite all that, Mueller confessed to her in Hawaii that he was thinking of extending his deployment for another six months, and maybe even making a career in the Marines. Ann was understandably ill at ease about the prospect. But as it turned out, she wouldn’t be a Marine wife for much longer. It was standard practice for Marines to be rotated out of combat, and later that year Mueller found himself assigned to a desk job at Marine headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. There he discovered something about himself: “I didn’t relish the US Marine Corps absent combat.” So he headed to law school with the goal of serving his country as a prosecutor. He went on to hold high positions in five presidential administrations. He led the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, overseeing the US investigation of the Lockerbie bombing and the federal prosecution of the Gambino crime family boss John Gotti. He became director of the FBI one week before September 11, 2001, and stayed on to become the bureau’s longest-serving director since J. Edgar Hoover. And yet, throughout his five-decade career, that year of combat experience with the Marines has loomed large in Mueller’s mind. “I’m most proud the Marines Corps deemed me worthy of leading other Marines,” he told me in a 2009 interview. June 2018. Subscribe to WIRED. Illustration by Jules Julien; Source Photo: Gerald Herbert/AP Today, the face-off between Special Counsel Robert Mueller and President Donald Trump stands out, amid the black comedy of Trump’s Washington, as an epic tale of diverging American elites: a story of two men—born just two years apart, raised in similar wealthy backgrounds in Northeastern cities, both deeply influenced by their fathers, both star prep school athletes, both Ivy League educated—who now find themselves playing very different roles in a riveting national drama about political corruption and Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. The two men have lived their lives in pursuit of almost diametrically opposed goals—Mueller a life of patrician public service, Trump a life of private profit. Those divergent paths began with Vietnam, the conflict that tore the country apart just as both men graduated from college in the 1960s. Despite having been educated at an elite private military academy, Donald Trump famously drew five draft deferments, including one for bone spurs in his feet. He would later joke, repeatedly, that his success at avoiding sexually transmitted diseases while dating numerous women in the 1980s was “my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.” Mueller, for his part, not only volunteered for the Marines, he spent a year waiting for an injured knee to heal so he could serve. And he has said \\xadlittle about his time in Vietnam over the years. When he was leading the FBI through the catastrophe of 9/11 and its aftermath, he would brush off the crushing stress, saying, “I’m getting a lot more sleep now than I ever did in Vietnam.” One of the only other times his staff at the FBI ever heard him mention his Marine service was on a flight home from an official international trip. They were watching We Were Soldiers, a 2002 film starring Mel Gibson about some of the early battles in Vietnam. Mueller glanced at the screen and observed, “Pretty accurate.” His reticence is not unusual for the generation that served on the front lines of a war that the country never really embraced. Many of the veterans I spoke with for this story said they’d avoided talking about Vietnam until recently. Joel Burgos, who served as a corporal with Mueller, told me at the end of our hour-long conversation, “I’ve never told anyone most of this.” Yet for almost all of them—Mueller included—Vietnam marked the primary formative experience of their lives. Nearly 50 years later, many Marine veterans who served in Mueller’s unit have email addresses that reference their time in Southeast Asia: gunnysgt, 2-4marine, semperfi, \\xadPltCorpsman, Grunt. One Marine’s email handle even references Mutter’s Ridge, the area where Mueller first faced large-scale combat in December 1968. The Marines and Vietnam instilled in Mueller a sense of discipline and a relentlessness that have driven him ever since. He once told me that one of the things the Marines taught him was to make his bed every day. I’d written a book about his time at the FBI and was by then familiar with his severe, straitlaced demeanor, so I laughed at the time and said, “That’s the least surprising thing I’ve ever learned about you.” But Mueller persisted: It was an important small daily gesture exemplifying follow-through and execution. “Once you think about it—do it,” he told me. “I’ve always made my bed and I’ve always shaved, even in Vietnam in the jungle. You’ve put money in the bank in terms of discipline.” Mueller’s former Princeton classmate and FBI chief of staff W. Lee Rawls recalled how Mueller’s Marine leadership style carried through to the FBI, where he had little patience for subordinates who questioned his decisions. He expected his orders to be executed in the Hoover building just as they had been on the battlefield. In meetings with subordinates, Mueller had a habit of quoting Gene Hackman’s gruff Navy submarine captain in the 1995 Cold War thriller Crimson Tide: “We’re here to preserve democracy, not to practice it.” Related Stories The White House Warns on Russian Router Hacking, But Muddles the Message\\n\\nA Guide to Russia’s High Tech Tool Box for Subverting US Democracy\\n\\nRobert Mueller Likely Knows How This All Ends Discipline has certainly been a defining feature of Mueller’s Russia investigation. In a political era of extreme TMI—marked by rampant White House leaks, Twitter tirades, and an administration that disgorges jilted cabinet-\\xadlevel officials as quickly as it can appoint new ones—the special counsel’s office has been a locked door. Mueller has remained an impassive cypher: the stoic, silent figure at the center of America’s political gyre. Not once has he spoken publicly about the Russia investigation since he took the job in May 2017, and his carefully chosen team of prosecutors and FBI agents has proved leakproof, even under the most intense of media spotlights. Mueller’s spokesperson, Peter Carr, on loan from the Justice Department, has essentially had one thing to tell a media horde ravenous for information about the Russia investigation: “No comment.” If Mueller’s discipline is reflected in the silence of his team, his relentlessness has been abundantly evident in the pace of indictments, arrests, and legal maneuvers coming out of his office. His investigation is proceeding on multiple fronts. He is digging into Russian information operations carried out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media platforms. In February his office indicted 13 people and three entities connected to the Internet Research Agency, the Russian organization that allegedly masterminded the information campaigns. He’s also pursuing those responsible for cyber intrusions, including the hacking of the email system at the Democratic National Committee. At the same time, Mueller’s investigators are probing the business dealings of Trump and his associates, an effort that has yielded indictments for tax fraud and conspiracy against Trump’s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, and a guilty plea on financial fraud and lying to investigators by Manafort’s deputy, Rick Gates. The team is also looking into the numerous contacts between Trump’s people and Kremlin-connected figures. And Mueller is questioning witnesses in an effort to establish whether Trump has obstructed justice by trying to quash the investigation itself. Almost every week brings a surprise development in the investigation. But until the next indictment or arrest, it’s difficult to say what Mueller knows, or what he thinks. Before he became special counsel, Mueller freely and repeatedly told me that his habits of mind and character were most shaped by his time in Vietnam, a period that is also the least explored chapter of his biography. This first in-depth account of his year at war is based on multiple interviews with Mueller about his time in combat—conducted before he became special counsel—as well as hundreds of pages of once-classified Marine combat records, official accounts of Marine engagements, and the first-ever interviews with eight Marines who served alongside Mueller in 1968 and 1969. They provide the best new window we have into the mind of the man leading the Russia investigation. Mueller volunteered for the Marines in 1966, right after graduating from Prince\\xadton. By late 1968 he was a lieutenant leading a combat platoon in Vietnam. Dan Winters; Archival Photo Courtesy of National Archives\\n\\nRobert Swan Mueller III, the first of five children and the only son, grew up in a stately stone house in a wealthy Philadelphia suburb. His father was a DuPont executive who had captained a Navy submarine-chaser in World War II; he expected his children to abide by a strict moral code. “A lie was the worst sin,” Mueller says. “The one thing you didn’t do was to give anything less than the truth to my mother and father.” He attended St. Paul’s prep school in Concord, New Hampshire, where the all-boys classes emphasized Episcopal ideals of virtue and manliness. He was a star on the lacrosse squad and played hockey with future US senator John Kerry on the school team. For college he chose his father’s alma mater, Princeton, and entered the class of 1966. The expanding war in Vietnam was a frequent topic of conversation among the elite students, who spoke of the war—echoing earlier generations—in terms of duty and service. “Princeton from ’62 to ’66 was a completely different world than ’67 onwards,” said Rawls, a lifelong friend of Mueller’s. “The anti-Vietnam movement was not on us yet. A year or two later, the campus was transformed.” On the lacrosse field, Mueller met David Hackett, a classmate and athlete who would profoundly affect Mueller’s life. Hackett had already enlisted in the Marines’ version of ROTC, spending his Princeton summers training for the escalating war. “I had one of the finest role models I could have asked for in an upperclassman by the name of David Hackett,” Mueller recalled in a 2013 speech as FBI director. “David was on our 1965 lacrosse team. He was not necessarily the best on the team, but he was a determined and a natural leader.” After he graduated in 1965, Hackett began training to be a Marine, earning top honors in his officer candidate class. After that he shipped out to Vietnam. In Mueller’s eyes, Hackett was a shining example. Mueller decided that when he graduated the following year, he too would enlist in the Marines. On April 30, 1967, shortly after Hackett had signed up for his second tour in Vietnam, his unit was ambushed by more than 75 camouflaged North Vietnamese troops who were firing down from bunkers with weapons that included a .50-\\xadcaliber machine gun. According to a Marine history, “dozens of Marines were killed or wounded within minutes.” Hackett located the source of the incoming fire and charged 30 yards across open ground to an American machine gun team to tell them where to shoot. Minutes later, as he was moving to help direct a neighboring platoon whose commander had been wounded, he was killed by a sniper. Posthumously awarded the Silver Star, Hackett’s commendation explained that he died “while pressing the assault and encouraging his Marines.” By the time word of Hackett’s death filtered back to the US, Mueller was already making good on his pledge to follow him into military service. The news only strengthened his resolve to become an infantry officer. “One would have thought that the life of a Marine, and David’s death in Vietnam, would argue strongly against following in his footsteps,” Mueller said in that 2013 speech. “But many of us saw in him the person we wanted to be, even before his death. He was a leader and a role model on the fields of Princeton. He was a leader and a role model on the fields of battle as well. And a number of his friends and teammates joined the Marine Corps because of him, as did I.” In mid-1966, Mueller underwent his military physical at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard; this was before the draft lottery began and before Vietnam became a divisive cultural watershed. He recalls sitting in the waiting room as another candidate, a strapping 6-foot, 280-pound lineman for the Philadelphia Eagles, was ruled 4-F—medically unfit for military service. After that it was Mueller’s turn to be rejected: His years of intense athletics, including hockey and lacrosse, had left him with an injured knee. The military declared that it would need to heal before he would be allowed to deploy. In the meantime, he married Ann Cabell Standish—a graduate of Miss Porter’s School and Sarah Lawrence—over Labor Day weekend 1966, and they moved to New York, where he earned a master’s degree in international relations at New York University. Once his knee had healed, Mueller went back to the military doctors. In 1967—just before Donald Trump received his own medical deferment for heel spurs—Mueller started Officer Candidate School at Quantico, Virginia. For high school, Mueller attended St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire. As a senior in 1962, Mueller (#12) played on the hockey team with future US senator John Kerry (#18). Dan Winters; Archival Photo by Rick Friedman/Getty Images\\n\\nLike Hackett before him, Mueller was a star in his Officer Candidate School training class. “He was a cut above,” recalls Phil Kellogg, who had followed one of his fraternity brothers into the Marines after graduating from the College of Santa Fe in New Mexico. Kellogg, who went through training with Mueller, remembers Mueller racing another candidate on an obstacle course—and losing. It’s the only time he can remember Mueller being bested. “He was a natural athlete and natural student,” Kellogg says. “I don’t think he had a hard day at OCS, to be honest.” There was, it turned out, only one thing he was bad at—and it was a failing that would become familiar to legions of his subordinates in the decades to come: He received a D in delegation. During the time Mueller spent in training, from November 1967 through July 1968, the context of the Vietnam War changed dramatically. The bloody Tet Offensive—a series of coordinated, widespread, surprise attacks across South Vietnam by the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese in January 1968—stunned America, and with public opinion souring on the conflict, Lyndon Johnson declared he wouldn’t run for reelection. As Mueller’s training class graduated, Walter Cronkite declared on the CBS Evening News that the war could not be won. “For it seems now more certain than ever,” Cronkite told his millions of viewers on February 27, 1968, “that the bloody experience of Vietnam is to end in a stalemate.” The country seemed to be descending into chaos; as the spring unfolded, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. Cities erupted in riots. Antiwar protests raged. But the shifting tide of public opinion and civil unrest barely registered with the officer candidates in Mueller’s class. “I don’t remember anyone having qualms about where we were or what we were doing,” Kellogg says. That spring, as Donald J. Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and began working for his father’s real estate company, Mueller finished up Officer Candidate School and received his next assignment: He was to attend the US Army’s Ranger School. Arriving in Vietnam, Mueller was well trained, but he was also afraid. “You were scared to death of the unknown,” he says. “More afraid in some ways of failure than death.” Mueller knew that only the best young officers went on to Ranger training, a strenuous eight-week advanced skills and leadership program for the military’s elite at Fort Benning, Georgia. He would be spending weeks practicing patrol tactics, assassination missions, attack strategies, and ambushes staged in swamps. But the implications of the assignment were also sobering to the newly minted officer: Many Marines who passed the course were designated as “recon Marines” in Vietnam, a job that often came with a life expectancy measured in weeks. Mueller credits the training he received at Ranger School for his survival in Vietnam. The instructors there had been through jungle combat themselves, and their stories from the front lines taught the candidates how to avoid numerous mistakes. Ranger trainees often had to function on just two hours of rest a night and a single daily meal. “Ranger School more than anything teaches you about how you react with no sleep and nothing to eat,” Mueller told me. “You learn who you want on point, and who you don’t want anywhere near point.” After Ranger School, he also attended Airborne School, aka jump school, where he learned to be a parachutist. By the fall of 1968, he was on his way to Asia. He boarded a flight from Travis Air Force Base in California to an embarkation point in Okinawa, Japan, where there was an almost palpable current of dread among the deploying troops. From Okinawa, Mueller headed to Dong Ha Combat Base near the so-called demilitarized zone—the dividing line between North and South Vietnam, established after the collapse of the French colonial regime in 1954. Mueller was determined and well trained, but he was also afraid. “You were scared to death of the unknown,” he says. “More afraid in some ways of failure than death, more afraid of being found wanting.” That kind of fear, he says “animates your unconscious.”\\n\\nFor American troops, 1968 was the deadliest year of the war, as they beat back the Tet Offensive and fought the battle of Hue. All told, 16,592 Americans were killed that year—roughly 30 percent of total US fatalities in the war. Over the course of the conflict, more than 58,000 Americans died, 300,000 were wounded, and some 2 million South and North Vietnamese died. Just 18 months after David Hackett was felled by a sniper, Mueller was being sent to the same region as his officer-training classmate Kellogg, who had arrived in Vietnam three months earlier. Mueller was assigned to H Company—Hotel Company in Marine parlance—part of the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Marine Regiment, a storied infantry unit that traced its origins back to the 1930s. The regiment had been fighting almost nonstop in Vietnam since May 1965, earning the nickname the Magnificent Bastards. The grueling combat took its toll. In the fall of 1967, six weeks of battle reduced the battalion’s 952 Marines to just 300 fit for duty. During the Tet Offensive, the 2nd Battalion had seen bitter and bloody fighting that never let up. In April 1968, it fought in the battle of Dai Do, a days-long engagement that killed nearly 600 North Vietnamese soldiers. Eighty members of the 2nd Battalion died in the fight, and 256 were wounded. David Harris, who arrived in Vietnam in May, joined the depleted unit just after Dai Do. “Hotel Company and all of 2/4 was decimated,” he says. “They were a skeleton crew. They were haggard, they were beat to death. It was just pitiful.” By the time Mueller was set to arrive six months later, the unit had rebuilt its ranks as its wounded Marines recovered and filtered back into the field; they had been tested and emerged stronger. By coincidence, Mueller was to inherit leadership of a Hotel Company platoon from his friend Kellogg. “Those kids that I had and Bob had, half of them were veterans of Dai Do,” Kellogg says. “They were field-sharp.” A corpsman of Company H aids a wounded Leatherneck of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, during Operation Saline II in the Quang Tri Province of Vietnam in 1968. Dan Winters; Archival Photo Courtesy of National Archives\\n\\nSecond Lieutenant Mueller, 24 years and 3 months old, joined the battalion in November 1968, one of 10 new officers assigned to the unit that month. He knew he was arriving at the so-called pointy end of the American spear. Some 2.7 million US troops served in Vietnam, but the vast majority of casualties were suffered by those who fought in “maneuver battalions” like Mueller’s. The war along the demilitarized zone was far different than it was elsewhere in Vietnam; the primary adversary was the North Vietnamese army, not the infamous Viet Cong guerrillas. North Vietnamese troops generally operated in larger units, were better trained, and were more likely to engage in sustained combat rather than melting away after staging an ambush. “We fought regular, hard-core army,” Joel Burgos says. “There were so many of them—and they were really good.” William Sparks, a private first class in Hotel Company, recalls that Mueller got off the helicopter in the middle of a rainstorm, wearing a raincoat—a telltale sign that he was new to the war. “You figured out pretty fast it didn’t help to wear a raincoat in Vietnam,” Sparks says. “The humidity just condensed under the raincoat—you were just as wet as you were without it.” As Mueller walked up from the landing zone, Kellogg—who had no idea Mueller would be inheriting his platoon—recognized his OCS classmate’s gait. “When he came marching up the hill, I laughed,” Kellogg says. “We started joking.” On Mueller’s first night in the field, his brand-new tent was destroyed by the wind. “That thing vanished into thin air,” Sparks says. He didn’t even get to spend one night.” Over the coming days, Kellogg passed along some of his wisdom from the field and explained the procedures for calling in artillery and air strikes. “Don’t be John Wayne,” he said. “It’s not a movie. Marines tell you something’s up, listen to them.” “The lieutenants who didn’t trust their Marines went to early deaths,” Kellogg says. And with that, Kellogg told their commander that Mueller was ready, and he hopped aboard the next helicopter out. Today, military units usually train together in the US, deploy together for a set amount of time, and return home together. But in Vietnam, rotations began—and ended—piecemeal, driven by the vagaries of injuries, illness, and individual combat tours. That meant Mueller inherited a unit that mixed combat-\\xadexperienced veterans and relative newbies. A platoon consisted of roughly 40 Marines, typically led by a lieutenant and divided into three squads, each led by a sergeant, which were then divided into three four-man “fire teams” led by corporals. While the lieutenants were technically in charge, the sergeants ran the show—and could make or break a new officer. “You land, and you’re at the mercy of your staff sergeant and your radioman,” Mueller says. Marines in the field knew to be dubious of new young second lieutenants like Mueller. They were derided as Gold Brickers, after the single gold bar that denoted their rank. “They might have had a college education, but they sure as hell didn’t have common sense,” says Colin Campbell, who was on Hotel Company’s mortar squad. Mueller knew his men feared he might be incompetent or worse. “The platoon was petrified,” he recalls. “They wondered whether the new green lieutenant was going to jeopardize their lives to advance his own career.” Mueller himself was equally terrified of assuming field command. As he settled in, talk spread about the odd new platoon leader who had gone to both Princeton and Army Ranger School. “Word was out real fast—Ivy League guy from an affluent family. That set off alarms. The affluent guys didn’t go to Vietnam then—and they certainly didn’t end up in a rifle platoon,” says VJ Maranto, a corporal in H Company. “There was so much talk about ‘Why’s a guy like that out here with us?’ We weren’t Ivy Leaguers.” Indeed, none of his fellow Hotel Company Marines had written their college thesis on African territorial disputes before the International Court of Justice, as Mueller had. Most were from rural America, and few had any formal education past high school. Maranto spent his youth on a small farm in Louisiana. Carl Rasmussen, a lance corporal, grew up on a farm in Oregon. Burgos was from the Mississippi Delta, where he was raised on a cotton plantation. After graduating from high school, David Harris had gone to work in a General Motors factory in his home state of Ohio, then joined the Marines when he was set to be drafted in the summer of 1967. Many of the Marines under Mueller’s command had been wounded at least once; 19-year-old corporal John C. Liverman had arrived in Vietnam just four months after a neighbor of his from Silver Spring, Maryland, had been killed at Khe Sanh—and had seen heavy combat much of the year. He’d been hit by shrapnel in March 1968 and then again in April, but after recovering in Okinawa, he had agitated to return to combat. Hotel Company quickly came to understand that its new platoon leader was no Gold Bricker. “He wanted to know as much as he could as fast as he could about the terrain, what we did, the ambushes, everything,” Maranto says. “He was all about the mission, the mission, the mission.”\\n\\nSecond Battalion’s mission, as it turned out, was straightforward: Search and destroy. “We stayed out in the bush, out in the mountains, just below DMZ, 24 hours a day,” David Harris says. “We were like bait. It was the same encounter: They’d hit us, we’d hit them, they’d disappear.” Frequent deaths and injuries meant that turnover in the field was constant; when Maranto arrived at Hotel Company, he was issued a flak jacket that had dried blood on it. “We were always low on men,” Colin Campbell says. Mueller’s unit was constantly on patrol; the battalion’s records described it as “nomadic.” Its job was to keep the enemy off-kilter and disrupt their supply lines. “You’d march all day, then you’d dig a foxhole and spend all night alternating going on watch,” says Bill White, a Hotel Company veteran. “We were always tired, always hungry, always thirsty. There were no showers.” In those first weeks, Mueller's confidence as a leader grew as he won his men’s trust and respect. “You’d sense his nervousness, but you’d never see that in his demeanor,” Maranto says. “He was such a professional.” The members of the platoon soon got acquainted with the qualities that would be familiar to everyone who dealt with Mueller later as a prosecutor and FBI director. He demanded a great deal and had little patience for malingering, but he never asked for more than he was willing to give himself. “He was a no-bullshit kind of guy,” White recalls. Sgt. Michael Padilla (left) with Cpl. Agustin Rosario (right), who was killed in action on December 11, 1968, during the operation at Mutter’s Ridge.

It was one of the only organized outposts nearby for Marines, a place for resupply, a shower, and hot food. Lance Corporal Robert W. Cromwell, who had celebrated his 20th birthday shortly before beginning his tour of duty, entertained his comrades with stories from his own period of R&R: He’d met his wife and parents in Hawaii to be introduced to his newborn daughter. “He was so happy to have a child and wanted to get home for good,” Harris says. On December 7 the battalion boarded helicopters for a new operation: to retake control of a hill in an infamous area known as Mutter’s Ridge. The strategically important piece of ground, which ran along four hills on the southern edge of the DMZ, had been the scene of fighting for more than two years and had been overrun by the North Vietnamese months before. Artillery, air strikes, and tank attacks had long since denuded the ridge of vegetation, but the surrounding hillsides and valleys were a jungle of trees and vines. When Hotel Company touched down and fanned out from its landing zones to establish a perimeter, Mueller was arriving to what would be his first full-scale battle. As the American units advanced, the North Vietnamese retreated. “They were all pulling back to this big bunker complex, as it turned out,” Sparks says. The Americans could see the signs of past battles all around them. “You’d see shrapnel holes in the trees, bullet holes,” Sparks says. After three days of patrols, isolated firefights with an elusive enemy, and multiple nights of American bombardment, another unit in 2nd Battalion, Fox Company, received the order to take some high ground on Mutter’s Ridge. Even nearly 50 years later, the date of the operation remains burned into the memories of those who fought in it: December 11, 1968. None of Mueller's fellow Marines had written their college thesis on African territorial disputes before the International Court of Justice, as Mueller had. That morning, after a night of air strikes and artillery volleys meant to weaken the enemy, the men of Fox Company moved out at first light. The attack went smoothly at first; they seized the western portions of the ridge without resistance, dodging just a handful of mortar rounds. Yet as they continued east, heavy small-arms fire started. “As they fought their way forward, they came into intensive and deadly fire from bunkers and at least three machine guns,” the regiment later reported. Because the vegetation was so dense, Fox Company didn’t realize that it had stumbled into the midst of a bunker complex. “Having fought their way in, the company found it extremely difficult to maneuver its way out, due both to the fire of the enemy and the problem of carrying their wounded.” Hotel Company was on a neighboring hill, still eating breakfast, when Fox Company was attacked. Sparks remembers that he was drinking a “Mo-Co,” C-rations coffee with cocoa powder and sugar, heated by burning a golf-ball-sized piece of C-4 plastic explosive. (“We were ahead of Starbucks on this latte crap,” he jokes.) They could hear the gunfire across the valley. “Lieutenant Mueller called, ‘Saddle up, saddle up,’” Sparks says. “He called for first squad—I was the grenade launcher and had two bags of ammo strapped across my chest. I could barely stand up.” Before they could even reach the enemy, they had to fight their way through the thick brush of the valley. “We had to go down the hill and come up Foxtrot Ridge. It took hours.” “It was the only place in the DMZ I remember seeing vegetation like that,” Harris says. “It was thick and entwining.” When the platoon finally crested the top of the ridge, they confronted the horror of the battlefield. “There were wounded people everywhere,” Sparks recalls. Mueller ordered everyone to drop their packs and prepare for a fight. “We assaulted right out across the top of the ridge,” he says. It wasn’t long before the unit came under heavy fire from small arms, machine guns, and a grenade launcher. “There were three North Vietnamese soldiers right in front of us that jumped right up and sprayed us with AK-47s,” Sparks says. They returned fire and advanced. At one point, a Navy corpsman with them threw a grenade, only to have it bounce off a tree and explode, wounding one of Hotel Company’s corporals. “It just got worse from there,” Sparks says.\\n\\nIn the next few minutes, numerous men went down in Mueller’s unit. Maranto remembers being impressed that his relatively green lieutenant was able to stay calm while under attack. “He’d been in-country less than a month—most of us had been in-country six, eight months,” Maranto says. “He had remarkable composure, directing fire. It was sheer terror. They had RPGs, machine gun, mortars.” Mueller realized quickly how much trouble the platoon was in. “That day was the second heaviest fire I received in Vietnam,” Harris says. “Lieutenant Mueller was directing traffic, positioning people and calling in air strikes. He was standing upright, moving. He probably saved our hide.” Cromwell, the lance corporal who had just become a father, was shot in the thigh by a .50-caliber bullet. When Harris saw his wounded friend being hustled out of harm’s way, he was oddly relieved at first. “I saw him and he was alive,” Harris says. “He was on the stretcher.” Cromwell would finally be able to spend some time with his wife and new baby, Harris figured. “You lucky sucker,” he thought. “You’re going home.” But Harris had misjudged the severity of his friend’s injury. The bullet had nicked one of Cromwell’s arteries, and he bled to death before he reached the field hospital. The death devastated Harris, who had traded weapons with Cromwell the night before—Harris had taken Cromwell’s M-14 rifle and Cromwell took Harris’ M-79 grenade launcher. “The next day when we hit the crap, they called for him, and he had to go forward,” Harris says. Harris couldn’t shake the feeling that he should have been the one on the stretcher. “I’ve only told two people this story.” The battle atop and around Mutter’s Ridge raged for hours, with the North Vietnamese fire coming from the surrounding jungle. “We got hit with an ambush, plain and simple,” Harris says. “The brush was so thick, you had trouble hacking it with a machete. If you got 15 meters away, you couldn’t see where you came from.” As the fighting continued, the Marines atop the ridge began to run low on supplies. “Johnny Liverman threw me a bag of ammo. He’d been ferrying ammo from one side of the ridge to the other,” Sparks recalls. Liverman was already wounded, but he was still fighting; then, during one of his runs, he came under more fire. “He got hit right through the head, right when I was looking at him. I got that ammo, I crawled up there and got his M-16 and told him I’d be back.” Sparks and another Marine sheltered behind a dead tree stump, trying to find any protection amid the firestorm. “Neither of us had any ammo left,” Sparks recalls. He crawled back to Liverman to try to evacuate his friend. “I got him up on my shoulder, and I got shot, and I went down,” he says. As he was lying on the ground, he heard a shout from atop the ridge, “Who’s that down there—are they dead?” It was Lieutenant Mueller. Sparks hollered back, “Sparks and Liverman.” “Hold on,” Mueller said, “We’re coming down to get you.” A few minutes later, Mueller appeared with another Marine, known as Slick. Mueller and Slick slithered Sparks into a bomb crater with Liverman and put a battle dress on Sparks’ wound. They waited until a helicopter gunship passed overhead, its guns clattering, to distract the North Vietnamese, and hustled back toward the top of the hill and comparative safety. An OV-10 attack plane overhead dropped smoke grenades to help shield the Marines atop the ridge. Mueller, Sparks says, then went back to retrieve the mortally wounded Liverman. The deaths mounted. Corporal Agustin Rosario—a 22-year-old father and husband from New York City—was shot in the ankle, and then, while he tried to run back to safety, was shot again, this time fatally. Rosario, too, died waiting for a medevac helicopter. Finally, as the hours passed, the Marines forced the North Vietnamese to withdraw. By 4:30 pm, the battlefield had quieted. As his commendation for the Bronze Star later read, “Second Lieutenant Mueller’s courage, aggressive initiative and unwavering devotion to duty at great personal risk were instrumental in the defeat of the enemy force and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.” As night fell, Hotel and Fox held the ground, and a third company, Golf, was brought forward as additional reinforcement. It was a brutal day for both sides; 13 Americans died and 31 were wounded. “We put a pretty good hurt on them, but not without great cost,” Sparks says. “My closest friends were all killed there on Foxtrot Ridge.” As the Americans explored the field around the ridge, they counted seven enemy dead left behind, in addition to seven others killed in the course of the battle. Intelligence reports later revealed that the battle had killed the commander of the 1st Battalion, 27th North Vietnamese Army Regiment, “and had virtually decimated his staff.” For Mueller, the battle had proved both to him and his men that he could lead. “The minute the shit hit the fan, he was there,” Maranto says. “He performed remarkably. After that night, there were a lot of guys who would’ve walked through walls for him.” That first major exposure to combat—and the loss of Marines under his command—affected Mueller deeply. “You’re standing there thinking, ‘Did I do everything I could?’” he says. Afterward, back at camp, while Mueller was still in shock, a major came up and slapped the young lieutenant on the shoulder, saying, “Good job, Mueller.” “That vote of confidence helped me get through,” Mueller told me. “That gesture pushed me over. I wouldn’t go through life guilty for screwing up.” The heavy toll of the casualties at Mutter’s Ridge shook up the whole unit. Cromwell’s death hit especially hard; his humor and good nature had knitted the unit together. “He was happy-go-lucky. He looked after the new guys when they came in,” Bill White recalls. For Harris, who had often shared a foxhole with Cromwell, the death of his best friend was devastating. White also took Cromwell’s death hard; overcome with grief, he stopped shaving. Mueller confronted him, telling him to refocus on the mission ahead—but ultimately provided more comfort than discipline. “He could’ve given me punishment hours,” White says, “but he never did.” Robert Mueller receives an award from his regimental commander Col. Martin “Stormy” Sexton in Dong Ha, South Vietnam in 1969. Dan Winters; Archival Photo Courtesy of the office of Robert Mueller\\n\\nDecades later, Mueller would tell me that nothing he ever confronted in his career was as challenging as leading men in combat and watching them be cut down. “You see a lot, and every day after is a blessing,” he told me in 2008. The memory of Mutter’s Ridge put everything, even terror investigations and showdowns with the Bush White House, into perspective. “A lot is going to come your way, but it’s not going to be the same intensity.” When Mueller finally did leave the FBI in 2013, he “retired” into a busy life as a top partner at the law firm WilmerHale. He taught some classes in cybersecurity at Stanford, he investigated the NFL’s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, and he served as the so-called settlement master for the Volkswagen Diesel\\xadgate scandal. While in the midst of that assignment—which required the kind of delicate give-and-take ill-suited to a hard-driving, no-nonsense Marine—the 72-year-old Mueller received a final call to public service. It was May 2017, just days into the swirling storm set off by the firing of FBI director James Comey, and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein wanted to know if Mueller would serve as the special counsel in the Russia investigation. The job—overseeing one of the most difficult and sensitive investigations ever undertaken by the Justice Department—may only rank as the third-hardest of Mueller’s career, after the post-9/11 FBI and after leading those Marines in Vietnam. Having accepted the assignment as special counsel, he retreated into his prosecutor’s bunker, cut off from the rest of America.\\n\\nIn January 1969, after 10 days of rain showers and cold weather, the unit got a three-day R&R break at Cua Viet, a nearby support base. They listened to Super Bowl III on the radio as Joe Namath and the Jets defeated the Baltimore Colts. “One touch of reality was listening to that,” Mueller says. In the field, they got little news about what was transpiring at home. In fact, later that summer, while Mueller was still deployed, Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the moon—an event that people around the world watched live on TV. Mueller wouldn’t find out until days afterward. “There was this whole segment of history you missed,” he says. R&R breaks were also rare opportunities to drink alcohol, though there was never much of it. Campbell says he drank just 15 beers during his 18 months in-country. “I can remember drinking warm beer—Ballantines,” he says. In camp, the men traded magazines like Playboy and mail-\\xadorder automotive catalogs, imagining the cars they would soup up when they returned to the States. They passed the time playing rummy or pinochle. For the most part, Mueller skipped such activities, though he was into the era’s music (Creedence Clearwater Revival was—and is—a particular favorite). “I remember several times walking into a bunker and finding him in a corner with a book,” Maranto says. “He read a lot, every opportunity.” Throughout the rest of the month, they patrolled, finding little contact with the enemy, although plenty of signs of their presence: Hotel Company often radioed in reports of finding fallen bodies and hidden supply caches, and they frequently took incoming mortar rounds from unseen enemies. Command under such conditions wasn’t easy; drug use was a problem, and racial tensions ran high. “Many of the GIs were draftees; they didn’t want to be there,” Maranto says. “When new people rotated in, they brought what was happening in the United States with them.” Mueller recalls at times struggling to get Marines to follow orders—they already felt that the punishment of serving in the infantry in Vietnam was as bad as it could get. “Screw that,” they’d reply sharply when ordered to do something they didn’t want to do. “What are you going to do? Send me to Vietnam?” Yet the Marines were bonded through the constant danger of combat. Everyone had close calls. Everyone knew that luck in the combat zone was finite, fate pernicious. “If the good Lord turned over a card up there, that was it,” Mueller says. Nights particularly were filled with dread; the enemy preferred sneak attacks, often in the hours before dawn. Colin Campbell recalls a night in his foxhole when he turned around to find a North Vietnamese soldier, armed with an AK-47, right behind him. “He’d gotten inside our perimeter. He had our back,” Campbell says. “Why didn’t he kill me and the other guy in the foxhole?” Campbell shouted, and the infiltrator bolted. “Another Marine down the line shot him dead.” Mueller was a constant presence in the field, regularly reviewing the code signs and passwords that identified friendly units to one another. “He was quiet and reserved. The planning was meticulous and detailed. He knew at night where every position was,” Maranto recalls. “It wouldn’t be unusual for him to come out and make sure the fire teams were correctly placed—and that you were awake.” The men I talked to who served alongside Mueller, men now in their seventies, mostly had strong memories of the type of leader Mueller had been. But many didn’t know, until I told them, that the man who led their platoon was now the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election. “I had no idea,” Burgos told me. “When you’ve been in combat that long, you don’t remember names. Faces you remember,” he says. Maranto says he only put two and two together recently, although he’d wondered for years if that guy who was the FBI director had served with him in Vietnam. “The name would ring a bell—you know that’s a familiar name—but you’re so busy with everyday life,” Maranto says.

       " \"A spate of hacked Instagram accounts. A $220 million lawsuit against AT&T. A bustling underground crime ring. They all have roots in an old problem that has lately found new urgency: SIM card swaps, a scam in which hackers steal your mobile identity—and use it to upend your life.\\n\\nAt its most basic level, a SIM swap is when someone convinces your carrier to switch your phone number over to a SIM card they own. They’re not doing it for prank call cover, or to rack up long-distance charges. By diverting your incoming messages, scammers can easily complete the text-based two-factor authentication checks that protect your most sensitive accounts. Or, if you don’t have two-factor set up in the first place, they can use your phone number to trick services into coughing up your passwords.\\n\\n'In most of the cases that we’ve seen, a sufficiently determined attacker can just take over someone’s online footprint.' Allison Nixon, Flashpoint\\n\\nSIM attacks appear to be behind a recent string of Instagram takeovers, as well as the very unfortunate, not great time a hacker posted Justin Bieber nudes from Selena Gomez’s account last year. But they can impact other corners of your life as well. A cryptocurrency investor this week claimed that a SIM swap resulted in the theft of $23.8 million-worth of tokens; he’s suing his carrier, AT&T, for 10 times that amount. And Motherboard recently documented a number of incidents in which SIM hijackers drained thousands of dollars out of people’s checking accounts.\\n\\nA sobering caveat: If a skilled SIM hijacker targets you, there’s realistically not much you can do to stop them, says Allison Nixon, threat research at security firm Flashpoint. “In most of the cases that we’ve seen, a sufficiently determined attacker can take over someone’s online footprint,” she says.\\n\\nThat’s because ultimately, the machinations behind SIM swaps are largely out of your control. Perfect security hygiene won’t always keep someone from fooling your carrier, and in fact, they may not even have to; Flashpoint has found some indications that SIM hijackers recruit retail workers at mobile shops to gain access to protected accounts. A comprehensive SIM swap fix would require fundamentally rethinking the role of phone numbers in 2018. “Phone numbers were never intended to be a way to confirm someone’s identity,” says Nixon. “Phone companies were never in the business to sell identity documents. It was imposed on them.”\\n\\nThe good news is, you can take steps to limit the chances that a SIM swap attack will happen to you—and limit the fallout if it does.\\n\\nStick a PIN in It\\n\\nEvery major US carrier offers you the option of putting a PIN or a passcode on your account. Take them up on it. Having one adds another layer of protection, another piece of information an attacker needs before they can compromise your identity. That won’t help against an insider threat, but it’s much better than nothing.\\n\\nOn AT&T, you can set up a “wireless passcode” that’s four to eight digits long by going to your profile, then Sign-in info, then Get a new passcode. You should also add what the carrier calls “extra security,” which just means it’ll require the passcode to manage your account online or in a retail store. You can find that by going again to Sign-in info, then Wireless passcode, and checking Manage extra security.\\n\\nVerizon actually requires a PIN, but to set yours up or change it, head to this site, then sign into your account. Enter the PIN of your choice twice, click Submit, and you’re done.\\n\\nFor T-Mobile, you have to call instead; dial 611 from your mobile phone and ask to add “Port Validation” to your account, which lets you choose a six to 15 digit PIN. On Sprint, sign into your account, click on My Sprint, then go to Profile and security. Scroll to Security information, and update your PIN there.\\n\\nYes, remembering another PIN is a pain, especially when you’ll likely only need it every couple of years. But it’s worth the effort. “Most people have that turned off because if they can’t remember their PIN they can’t go into the local Verizon store and get a new phone,” says Chet Wisniewski, principle research scientist at security firm Sophos. “If you can turn a PIN on with your mobile carrier to prevent your number from being manipulated, you should. Go ahead and write it down. No one’s going to break into your house and steal your notepad from underneath your underwear in your secret drawer in your bedroom.”\\n\\nUse Better Two-Factor\\n\\nWe’ve talked about this recently, but it bears repeating. Getting your two-factor authentication codes over SMS is better than nothing, but it won’t help at all if a SIM swap hits. What will work? Using an authentication app instead.\\n\\nApps like Google Authenticator and Authy give you that extra layer of security like SMS-based two-factor does, but they also tie it to your physical device rather than the number the phone company assigned to you. They show you a six-digit code that updates every 30 seconds or so, and stays in constant sync with whatever service you connect them to.\\n\\n'The challenge we have is these app developers need a universal identifier, and they’ve just decided that the phone numbers as good as anything.' Chet Wisniewski, Sophos\\n\\nWant to step your two-factor up even further? Opt instead for a physical authentication method, like a Yubikey. These little fobs fit on your keychain, and plug into your computer’s USB port to help verify your identity. (For what it's worth, you can get a free YubiKey 4 with a new WIRED subscription.) “If you’ve enabled a phsyical token, plus your password, and you turn off SMS, then someone literally is going to have to steal your keys. That raises the stakes to a whole other level,” says Wisniewski.\\n\\nNot all services allow for tougher two-factor. (Instagram’s the most notable example, although the social network says it’s working on expanding the options it offers.) But switch it on where you can to give yourself the best shot at staying safe.\\n\\nExtra Measures\\n\\nIf a hacker has a phone number that’s associated with some of your online accounts, they can sometimes circumvent two-factor requirements altogether—which gets back to the problem of using phone numbers as identifiers in the first place. Disentangling yourself from those seven digits is hard to do at scale, but it’s worth at least trying on especially sensitive accounts, or if you might be a high-value target.\\n\\n“If there’s one particular thing that you have that you know a thief would go after, like your bank account or your bitcoin holdings or your user name on social media, obviously keep that account separate from the rest of your online identity,” says Nixon. “If you’re extra paranoid, you can have a separate phone number, and keep that phone number secret. I know that’s kind of over the top, but some people who try to protect themselves from this attack vector do try things like that.”\\n\\nFor services that require a phone number of some sort on record, you can swap in a Google Voice number, for instance. But Wisniewski suggests that the added complexity it adds to your life might not be worth it for most people, especially since so many apps tie your account to the number associated with your phone. Which, again, gets back to the core problem.\\n\\n“The challenge we have is these app developers need a universal identifier, and they’ve just decided that the phone numbers as good as anything. We don’t want national ID cards, and we don’t have any central authentication authority,” says Wisniewski. “They’re struggling to find something they can use to identify you, and sadly they’ve decided on the phone number, which is not incredibly secure.”\\n\\nThe other step you can take, however pat it sounds, is vigilance. If your smartphone suddenly stops working, or messages stop going through, you know you’ve lost your SIM. The sooner you act to preempt account takeovers from there, the better off you’ll be.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'For the past week, psychologists all over America have been freaking out.\\n\\nThe cause of their agita was an observation by a psychology graduate student from the University of Minnesota named Max Hui Bai. Like many researchers, Bai uses Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, where individuals sign up to complete simple tasks, such as taking surveys for academics or marketers, and earn a low fee. On Tuesday, August 7, he posed a simple question in a Facebook group for psychology researchers: \"Have anyone used Mturk in the last few weeks and notice any quality drop?\"\\n\\nAs he would later elaborate in a blog post, Bai had found that the surveys he conducted with MTurk were full of nonsense answers to open-ended questions and respondents with duplicate GPS locations. He said he had to throw out nearly half of the data in his most recent survey, a sharp increase from what he was used to seeing. His Facebook post garnered 181 comments, with other researchers describing similar signs of low-quality data in their own recent work. A number of them wondered if the culprit was bots—automated programs mimicking human behavior, not the actual human labor MTurk is supposed to supply.\\n\\nThe discussion soon spread over Twitter and email, until it appeared the whole field was worried about MTurk. By Friday, New Scientist ran an article with the headline “Bots on Amazon’s MTurk Are Ruining Psychology Studies.” One psychology professor mused on Facebook, “I wonder if this is the end of MTurk research?”\\n\\nIf that were the case, it would be a pretty big deal. Thousands of published social science studies use MTurk survey data every year, according to Panos Ipeirotis, a data scientist at New York University’s Stern School of Business.\\n\\n\"When most of us think of bots, we think of large networks of criminals, but a bot is just a tool for automation.\" Reid Tatoris, Distil Networks\\n\\nBut here’s the thing: It’s hard to know for sure if what Bai reported was the result of bots run amok. There are plenty of explanations for junk responses on MTurk. Bai recognizes this. “It might be bots, it might be human-augmented bots, or it might be humans who are tired of taking the survey and are just randomly clicking the buttons,” he says. It could also be the result of poor survey design, as Joe Miele, who operates an MTurk data consultancy, pointed out in response to the uproar.\\n\\nAnd not all bot-like behavior on MTurk is considered bad. The platform\\'s Acceptable Use Policy says that Amazon is “generally OK with you using scripts and automated tools” to more efficiently preview and pick tasks. It’s not uncommon for MTurk workers, or Turkers, to use scripts to help them find high-paying tasks they’re suitable for and to accept them quickly. What you cannot do is complete those tasks using automated tools, because then you aren’t using your human intelligence to do the job, and that’s the whole point of MTurk. That hasn’t stopped some people from reportedly using tools to automate filling out forms, but it’s not clear yet whether their use is on the rise, or even that common. Amazon will only say this behavior is against its rules.\\n\\n“There are bots on MTurk and have been for years,” says digital labor researcher Rochelle LaPlante, a former moderator of Reddit’s r/mturk subreddit. “I don’t know if this new flare of discussion is actually an increase in bots, or just an increase in researchers talking about it and actively searching their data for it.”\\n\\nMTurk and Social Science\\n\\nWhen it launched in 2005, Mechanical Turk was a game-changer. It offered a wider pool for researchers than undergraduates on campus, who before online crowdsourcing had been the main participants in many of these studies, and for a relatively low cost. MTurk ushered in a \"golden age\" for social science research. Today, data gathered on the platform is used in thousands of studies a year.\\n\\nBut all along there have also been reservations about the site and that data’s reliability. People have worried they could get scammed—requesters about getting back bad work, and workers about taking on tasks that never pay out. Marketers and researchers worried that the Turker population wasn’t representative enough for their surveys. And the incredibly low pay—just a few cents per task—has disconcerted labor activists and ethicists, who wonder if it’s kosher for scientists to rely on laborers who are making so little. It also provides an incentive for workers to complete tasks as quickly as possible. Researchers do have control over how much they compensate Turkers for work and can opt to pay more if they want. At the same time, scientists are concerned about keeping costs down, and institutional review boards have often expressed concerns (wrongly, some say) that high pay for human research subjects could be coercive.\\n\\nAs more researchers used MTurk, they’ve also discovered ways to mitigate many of these concerns. Ipeirotis has found that the Turker population is just as representative as university undergraduates for survey populations, and the data could be just as reliable as long as people took proper precautions in designing their studies. As for bot work, experts say that researchers can avoid problems by setting up their surveys with stringent parameters and designing tasks that are difficult to automate.\\n\\n“Most people are, by now, smart enough to deal with noise that comes from workers that do not pay attention, or from bots,” Ipeirotis says. Notably, Bai and many of the researchers who reported an uptick in bad data this summer were using Captcha and attention checks, as experts advise, though Miele and some researchers in the Facebook group suggest perhaps their participant qualifications could have been stronger.\\n\\nKathryn Johnson, a psychology professor at Arizona State University, spent the past week going back over her data to see if what Bai reported on his blog was true for her research. “I usually have one MTurker study going a month,” she says.\\n\\nShe found the same two troubling things in her most recent MTurk studies: repeated GPS locations and nonsense answers to open-ended questions. But location data, whether an IP address or GPS, is not by itself a reliable indicator of fraudulent behavior, four different MTurk and bot experts told WIRED. So if that’s the only suspicious thing that researchers are seeing in their results, they should not worry.\\n\\nThe nonsense answers are more meaningful. A bunch of researchers told Bai that they had repeated instances of survey respondents replying “nice” or “good” to open-ended questions for which those words made no sense.\\n\\n“There are browser extensions that fill forms with random answers, so I’m certain some of [what they are seeing] is this,” LaPlante says, but she is quick to note it could also be people not answering the surveys carefully. Repeated bad answers could be Turkers copying and pasting quickly so they can complete more surveys and earn more money. It could also mean people with poor English skills are taking the surveys, notes Miele.\\n\\nBut How Big a Problem Are Bots?\\n\\nThough Amazon explicitly disallows bots that complete jobs on Mechanical Turk, the company is not very forthcoming about how big a problem they are on the platform. Perhaps it’s because they haven’t needed to be. Unlike Twitter, which in light of its well-known bot infestations has had to be vocal about kicking them off, the possibility of bots on MTurk struck many people as news this week.\\n\\nAmazon also makes setting up multiple or fake accounts a bit more difficult, by requiring workers to provide valid tax information. But that doesn’t prevent a verified person from supplementing their own MTurk labor with an automated system. It would be much easier to set a script on your account to complete a bunch of jobs while you sleep or go to your other job, for instance.\\n\\n“When most of us think of bots, we think of large networks of criminals, but a bot is just a tool for automation. It could be used by one individual to say, instead of me making $5 a day in Amazon Turk, I’m going to use it to make $20 a day. It’s not necessarily nefarious or evil, but there is a gray area,” says Reid Tatoris, vice president of product outreach and marketing at Distil Networks, which detects and protects clients from automated attacks and bots. “But it’s definitely not in compliance,” he added.\\n\\n\"There are a dozen people I know of personally who run bots, and they get away with it.\" Kristy Milland\\n\\nIn response to this week’s bot worries, a representative for Amazon told WIRED that the company suspends or terminates anyone found completing MTurk tasks by automated means. “We have both automated and manual mechanisms to detect fraud and misuse of the service by bots, and we are always improving these mechanisms as we discover new forms of abuse,” the representative said.\\n\\nAmazon wouldn’t say whether there has been an uptick in automated behavior on MTurk recently, nor would the company discuss specific examples of bots or accounts.\\n\\n“This has been going on since the beginning of Mechanical Turk, since forever,” says Kristy Milland, who has conducted research on the platform and worked as a Turker herself for 12 years. She describes herself as an MTurk labor activist, working to encourage fair pay on the platform. “There are a dozen people I know of personally who run bots, and they get away with it,” she says, adding that it would take her 30 seconds to write a simple script to fill in survey information automatically on MTurk.\\n\\nForums for Turkers are full of conversations about scripts, some of which would violate Amazon’s terms. You can also find YouTube videos showing Turkers how to write a script to auto-fill answers. In Milland’s opinion, this behavior is in some ways inevitable thanks to the platform’s policies.\\n\\n“Mechanical Turk workers have been treated really, really badly for 12 years, and so in some ways I see this as a point of resistance,\" she says. \"If we were paid fairly on the platform, nobody would be risking their account this way.”\\n\\nAnyone who finds a possible bot account, or an account otherwise violating MTurk’s terms, can alert Amazon via a contact form on the site. Milland says she has sent Amazon multiple MTurk IDs that are running bots, but the accounts are still active.\\n\\n“They don’t want to admit [bots are on the platform],” Milland says. “There are enough people who don’t know that such a thing is possible that they don’t want to even let a whisper of the fact that it’s a possibility out. So they won’t talk about it. I send it on. I do not get a reply at all.”\\n\\nAmazon’s silence on the topic is striking, considering the level of concern among researchers. Members of the Facebook group where Bai originally posted about MTurk say they’ve reached out to Amazon this week, but do not report hearing back. Last week, Bai created a questionnaire for researchers—not on MTurk—and is now leading a crowdsourced effort among social scientists to figure out how much of the bad data he has seen is new, how large the problem is, and how to stop it. He’s still analyzing that survey, but he plans to send their research to Amazon in the hopes that the data will force the company to respond.\\n\\nIf we think of Bai’s quest like a scientific experiment, we just passed the hypothesis phase (“There may be more bad data on MTurk, and it may be due to bots”) and have entered data-collection mode. The results aren’t in yet.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " \"Bounding around on giant hind limbs, using its giant tail to balance, the well-named giant kangaroo rat of Southern California is half Pokemon, half Mighty Mouse. It emerges at night to forage on seeds, building up underground stores. When it’s not busy foraging, it’s busy scrapping with its peers to claim territory. It dominates these grasslands, outcompeting smaller rodents while doing its best to dodge foxes and snakes.\\n\\nBut the giant kangaroo rat isn’t invincible. In 2012, a once-in-a-millennium drought, exacerbated by climate change, sent the rodent’s California ecosystem into chaos. Luckily, scientists were watching, and they’ve now published a fascinating analysis of how the giant kangaroo rat and over 400 other species of plants and animals struggled and triumphed in a world gone dry. If you want to see how climate change is going to affect Earth’s most precious ecosystems, this is a good place to start.\\n\\nThe Carrizo Plain National Monument is a portal to a time before big ag turned California’s Central Valley into a monocultural wasteland. The refuge is home to insane wildflower blooms in the spring, and a long cast of characters—arthropods like wind scorpions (not really scorpions, but equally horrifying, if you feel like googling), reptiles like the side-blotched lizard, and fliers like barn owls. All of them are delicately balanced in an ecosystem of eaters and eatees.\\n\\nTo keep track of those relationships, scientists at several US universities had to trap and collect all these critters. Some, like mammalian carnivores, they tracked at night by driving around shining spotlights, hoping to catch the glow of their eyes. They set traps for others, like insects and rodents. And they walked around doing plant surveys in April, when things were nice and bloomed up—or, at least, when they were supposed to be.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, the plants suffered right from the start of the drought. That in turn was bad news for the giant kangaroo rats, which survive on seeds. But it wasn’t until the second year that their numbers crashed, likely because they were surviving on seed stores. Then the carnivores took a hit: the owls and foxes and snakes that were now out of a reliable food source.\\n\\nOpportunists were waiting, though, to fill in the vacuum left by the giant kangaroo rats. Rarer, smaller species that require fewer resources, like the short-nosed kangaroo rat and southern grasshopper mouse, exploded in number between 2013 and 2015. And the rodents weren’t alone. While barn owls and western meadowlarks were “losers” during the drought, killdeer and greater roadrunners were “winners.” The blunt-nosed leopard lizard suffered; the side-blotched lizard came up in the world.\\n\\n“The drought kind of knocked down the species that were dominating and allowed the underdogs to do better and stay in the system,” says wildlife ecologist Laura Prugh of the University of Washington, lead author on the new paper in Nature Climate Change.\\n\\nFor all the winners and losers, nearly three quarters of species weren’t strongly affected by the drought. “That was definitely a surprise,” says Prugh. “It looked kind of like the surface of the moon by year three of the drought. But when we went out and did our surveys, we would catch animals, we would find some plants here and there.”\\n\\nIn a perverse kind of way, the researchers were fortunate that the drought landed right in the middle of their survey. It’s rare that scientists get to study this many species over such a long period of time, and even rarer that they get to see a climate-change-exacerbated drought rapidly morph an ecosystem. “To address this number of species in a study across a disturbance like this is really unusual,” says Lee Hannah, senior scientist of climate change biology at Conservation International, who wasn’t involved in the study.\\n\\n“The other neat thing that this showed was that climate change could be favoring rare species in some cases, and we know that disturbance is important for diversity,” Hannah adds. Not that anyone is arguing that climate change is good for life on Earth. But by doing long-term, comprehensive surveys of wildlife, scientists can get a better idea of the sometimes surprising ways that climate change can alter ecosystems.\\n\\n“A study like this allows us to better understand whether our management decisions are focused on the right species and habitat conditions,” says Scott Butterfield, senior scientist at the Nature Conservancy, which helped fund the work. The giant kangaroo rat, for example. “They are both a keystone species in this system and a species that is negatively impacted by extreme drought.”\\n\\nSo what becomes of the giant kangaroo rat now? “That's one thing we're really looking at,” says Prugh. “Because I think the story of how this system recovers is going to be just as interesting as what happened during the drought.”\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories\",\n",
       " 'If, like most people, you thought Google stopped tracking your location once you turned off Location History in your account settings, you were wrong. According to an AP investigation published Monday, even if you disable Location History, the search giant still tracks you every time you open Google Maps, get certain automatic weather updates, or search for things in your browser. There\\'s a way to stop it—but it takes some digging.\\n\\nThe problem affects anyone with an Android phone and iPhone users running Google Maps on their devices, according to the AP report, which researchers at Princeton University verified. That\\'s more than two billion people.\\n\\nThe Google support page for managing and deleting your Location History says that once you turn it off, \"the places you go are no longer stored. When you turn off Location History for your Google Account, it\\'s off for all devices associated with that Google Account.\" The AP\\'s investigation found that\\'s not true. In fact, turning off your Location History only stops Google from creating a timeline of your location that you can view. Some apps will still track you and store time-stamped location data from your devices.\\n\\nMore specifically, the AP was able to track Princeton researcher Gunes Acar\\'s home address, as well as his daily activities, using just Google Web & App activity, which he had shared with the news agency.\\n\\n\"If Google is representing to its users that they can turn off or pause location tracking but it\\'s nevertheless tracking their location, that seems like textbook deception to me,\" says Alan Butler, senior council at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\\n\\nTo actually turn off location tracking, Google says you have to navigate to a setting buried deep in your Google Account called Web & App Activity, which is set by default to share your information, including not just location but IP address and more. Finding that setting isn\\'t easy. At all.\\n\\nSign in to your Google account on a browser on iOS or your desktop, or through the Android settings menu. In the browser, access your account settings by finding Google Account in the dropdown in the upper right-hand corner, then head to Personal Info & Privacy, choose Go to My Activity, then in the left-hand nav click Activity Controls. Once there you\\'ll see the setting called Web & App Activity, which you can toggle off.\\n\\nOn your Android phone, go from Google settings to Google Account, then tap on Data & personalization. You\\'ll find Web & App Activity there.\\n\\nGoogle further buries the notion that Web & App Activity has anything to do with location. In fact, the setting sits right above the Location History option, suggesting at a glance that the two things are quite distinct. And Google\\'s vanilla description of Web & App Activity is that it \"Saves your activity on Google sites and apps to give you faster searches, better recommendations, and more personalized experiences in Maps, Search, and other Google services.\" From there, you have to tap Learn more, then scroll to What\\'s saved as Web & App Activity, and tap again on Info about your searches & more before Google says anything about location whatsoever.\\n\\nTo stop that tracking, toggle the blue Web & App Activity slider to off. Google will then give you a popup warning: \"Pausing Web & App Activity may limit or disable more personalized experiences across Google services. For example, you may stop seeing more relevant search results or recommendations about places you care about. Even when this setting is paused, Google may temporarily use information from recent searches in order to improve the quality of the active search session.\"\\n\\n\\'This really reads like a classic case of an unfairly deceptive business practice. I really think that the FTC needs to investigate right away.\\' Alan Butler, EPIC\\n\\nGoogle told the AP that it provides \"clear descriptions of these tools,\" but it takes eight taps on an Android phone—if you know exactly where you\\'re going—to even access that description to begin with. As the AP notes, most people who explicitly turned off their Location History tracking, as WIRED and many other privacy conscious publications have advised people to do, would have assumed they had already taken all steps necessary to keep their location private.\\n\\nAs well they should. Google itself offers at least three support pages on location: Manage or delete your Location History, Turn location on or off for your Android device, and Manage location settings for Android apps. None of these makes any mention of Web & App Activity.\\n\\nIn spite of this, a Google spokesperson told WIRED that \"we make sure Location History users know that when they disable the product, we continue to use location to improve the Google experience when they do things like perform a Google search or use Google for driving directions.\" This apparently refers to a warning that appears if you turn off Location History, which says that it \"does not affect other location services on your device.\" However, nowhere in that popup does it indicate that you can turn off other forms of location tracking by pausing Web & App Activity.\\n\\n\"Tracking people without their consent and without proper controls in place is creepy and wrong,\" wrote UC Berkeley graduate researcher K. Shankari in a blog post that first alerted the AP to the problem.\\n\\nBeyond creepiness, though, Google\\'s location-tracking may also violate the Federal Trade Commission\\'s consumer protection statutes against deceptive privacy practices. \"This really reads like a classic case of an unfairly deceptive business practice. I really think that the FTC needs to investigate right away,\" says Butler.\\n\\nGoogle\\'s Location History situation is reminiscent of Facebook\\'s various runnings with the FTC. In 2011, the agency famously settled with Facebook over the social media giant\\'s inability to keep privacy promises to consumers. As part of that deal, Facebook agreed to a consent decree in which it promised to reform how it tracked and shared user data. That decree has been in the news lately, after the FTC opened a new investigation this spring into whether Facebook\\'s data sharing with Cambridge Analytica violated its 2011 settlement. The FTC has more recently penalized Uber, Vizio, the phone maker Blu, and many others for misleading customers about how their data was collected, stored, and shared.\\n\\nFormer FTC chief technologist Ashkan Soltani noted in a tweet that Google\\'s \"confusing privacy dialogue\" may merit a closer look from the agency.\\n\\n\"Google’s reaction—that users can delete individual data points, or users can go deep down in settings and turn off certain web settings that appear to have nothing to do with location, therefore it should be okay, I think fundamentally misunderstands what they’re dealing with,\" says Butler. \"When you’re creating a historical log of someone’s movements over time, that’s information that’s uniquely sensitive and needs to be handled accordingly.\"\\n\\nThe revelations are likely to touch off a firestorm for Google. For now, the best thing you can do is navigate through your labyrinthine settings, and hit \"pause\" on something you likely thought you\\'d already stopped.\\n\\nCorrection on 8/15/2018: An earlier version of this article misspelled K. Shankari\\'s name.\\n\\nMore Great WIRED Stories',\n",
       " 'Kathy Zhou never considered herself the type of woman who would enter a beauty pageant. But this May, the Pinterest engineer found herself among a cluster of young professionals in a San Francisco coworking space, ready to be converted to the gospel of pageantry. They had gathered for an Imagine Talks forum, one of the TED-style leadership panels organized by the Miss Asian Global and Miss Asian America pageant—a competition that hopes to remake the rules of pageantry into a culturally rewarding, even feminist, event. By offering workshops on subjects like women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship, MAG, as the pageant is often called, aims to transform the beauty pageant into a useful platform for its participants; by including only Asian women, the organizers say, it’s helping contestants think about their ethnicity as something to be celebrated. This talk, for instance, was themed around the subject “girl boss” and included an all-Asian panel of women: a sex-toy mogul, a skin-care specialist, a community activist, a marketer, and two former beauty queens. “When in doubt, think like a mediocre white man,” the sex-toy mogul, Ti Chang, encouraged the audience. Laughs erupted when Nisha Baxi, a director of marketing at Salesforce, mimicked her father’s Indian accent to note his wisdom: “Fake it till you make it, beta.” Wearing bright, Barbie-doll-pink heels, Crystal Lee—a Stanford graduate, cofounder of a Dropbox-like online vault, and the first runner-up to Miss America 2014—spoke of how her male colleagues told her to omit her pageant experience from LinkedIn. “It doesn’t look good,” she recalled them saying. The directors of MAG, however, hope their pageant can serve as a résumé builder. Held in the Bay Area for the last 33 years, MAG is structured like an ordinary beauty pageant—contestants compete on an optional talent, cultural attire, evening gowns, a Q&A round called “Platform and Poise,” and a swimsuit division bearing the moniker “Form and Fitness.” Organizers and participants argue that MAG disrupts the sexy standard of Miss USA or Miss Universe, combining instead the wholesome goodness of Miss America with professional achievement, which organizers say is important for them to be taken seriously. But, yes, there’s still a swimsuit competition. And looks matter. The organizers screen head shots and body shots along with résumés, platform statements, and an optional video showcasing talent, to see who can “deliver ROI,” as Francis Kong, one of the pageant’s advisers, told me, adding that MAG girls are the “prettiest smart girls,” or the “smartest pretty girls.” In the weeks leading up to the pageant, volunteers train the \"delegates,\" MAG’s preferred term for contestants, in the right and wrong ways to approach investors who sponsor their participation. This system is designed to reinforce contestants’ networking skills and, above all, field “good” representatives—women who can stand for themselves as well as for an entire continent. That’s why, instead of calling itself a beauty pageant, MAG prefers the term \"cultural pageant.\" Some of the women found wearing a swimsuit in front of hundreds of people, including their families, empowering. Jessica Chou In the cultural-attire event, participants donned outfits that celebrated their ethnicity, often with a modern flair. Jessica Chou Crowning women with visibility and responsibility, MAG organizers hope to prepare its entrants to navigate the challenges of their professional lives. Asians and Asian-Americans are ubiquitous within tech companies, their food is appreciated by white CEOs, their homelands replicated by ethnoburbs like South San Francisco, Fremont, and Daly City. And yet their career trajectory is limited. According to a 2017 report, Asians are the least likely racial group to be promoted for leadership and management positions in Silicon Valley, a phenomenon nicknamed the “bamboo ceiling.” The report also found that race, more than gender, remained a more significant factor when it came to career advancement. By providing a place where women are celebrated for the things that might be a hindrance in Silicon Valley—their femaleness, their Asianness, and yes, maybe also their beauty—MAG organizers believe they are cultivating a cohort that is empowered to break into leadership. But in the era of #MeToo—when Miss America has decided to eliminate its swimsuit competition, and Donald Trump’s 19-year reign over the Miss Universe empire remains linked to his sexual-assault allegations—beauty pageants remain a familiar event with a dubious aim: parading women’s bodies, even if in tandem with their minds, for judgment. Though MAG supporters argue their event is different, if only by the nature of the ethnicities it celebrates, the question remains whether an event based on the most patriarchal trope—the beauty pageant—can truly offer something close to the buzzy empowerment it proselytizes. Beauty pageants remain a familiar event with a dubious aim: parading women’s bodies, even if in tandem with their minds, for judgment. Jessica Chou At the panel, at least one woman was convinced: “How do you talk openly about self-doubt? How do you overcome it?” The questions came from Zhou, the Pinterest engineer. She had already submitted her application to this year’s pageant, the first one she had ever considered joining.\\n\\nIt was Rose Chung’s love of pageants that lead her to found Miss Asian Global. Growing up, Chung dreamed of being crowned Miss Chinatown in the annual pageant hosted by San Francisco’s Chinese Chamber of Commerce. To Chung, the honor affirmed intelligence, culture, and leadership potential. Winning, which she did in 1981, ushered Chung into a world of previously inaccessible community events and the great networks of family associations in San Francisco’s Chinatown. She grew up there with an immigrant widow mother who didn’t vocally support Chung’s pageantry, but nevertheless gossiped about her daughter’s success with fellow seamstress workers. As Chung participated in and organized more pageants and events, she became a fixture in the Chinatown community. In 1985, an acquaintance requested that Chung produce a pageant for an Asian arts festival to be held in Santa Clara. The demographics of the Bay Area were changing, and he wanted to spread his business to Asian-Americans beyond Chinatown. A pan-Asian arts festival would be a chance to unite different ethnicities, he believed, and the activities around the pageant—signing up sponsors, selling tickets—would attract the broader market. That year, Chung created the first Miss Asian California pageant at the Santa Clara County fairgrounds. By 1991—around the time other pan-ethnic pageants like Miss Black USA in Washington, DC, and Miss US Latina in Miami were emerging—it had a new name: Miss Asian America. As the years went on, interest in competing grew outside the US, in places like Vietnam, Hong Kong, Canada, and China. (The pageant officially rebranded itself Miss Asian Global and Miss Asian America in 2012, to expand the pageant’s market outside the country and offer non-US citizens living in the US a chance to enter the pageant.) Winning the Miss Chinatown pageant ushered Rose Chung into a world of previously inaccessible community events. The experience lead her to found Miss Asian Global. Jessica Chou Pageants for communities of color have existed since the 1930s, says Afia Ofori-Mensa, a professor at Oberlin College who teaches the popular course How to Win a Beauty Pageant. They emerged as vehicles for immigrant communities of varying backgrounds to celebrate a unified vision of their heritage. The pageants would also draw local business and—for the Chinese-American community in particular—quell Cold War anxiety by displaying a pointedly feminine version of Chinese-ness. “Because femininity is considered to be nonthreatening when it comes to gender, beauty pageants have proven, in many cases, to be a way that people perform identity,” Ofori-Mensa says. But from its start, onlookers viewed beauty contests with a critical eye, even as some tried to subvert the tradition. In the 1880s, when P. T. Barnum would put on beauty contests alongside traveling circus shows, “respectable” white women shunned the spectacle of being judged in public, a process that too closely resembled a slave auction. By the 1900s, as women agitated for the right to vote, pageantry—performative public displays of sketches and processions, complete with sashes and titles—became ways to showcase the values of the suffragists. By the 1960s, the birth of a new technology—television—had boosted a once-small pageant called Miss America to the top of our cultural conversation. Viewership skyrocketed as TV sets became a household staple. And angst was brewing. On the night of the 1968 Miss America pageant, a group of women gathered on the boardwalk in Atlantic City. They threw their bras, girdles, false eyelashes, and other items they considered physical manifestations of the patriarchy into a “freedom trash can”—to protest what they saw as the pageant’s inherent misogyny and objectification of women. They didn’t actually burn their bras (they didn’t have a fire permit), but many consider this “bra-burning” event as the kickoff of the second wave of feminism. That same night on the boardwalk, a group of local NAACP chapters put on the first Miss Black America pageant. It was their own protest—against the prevailing whiteness of pageants. Though Miss America had dropped its rule that contestants must be “of good health and of the white race” in 1940, it would take three decades before a black woman even competed. To this day, the Miss America pageant has crowned only nine black women and two Asian women as its beauty queen. Though Asian pageants don’t have the reach of national events like Miss America, the attention accorded to MAG winners enhances their reputation. Every competition produces a court of winners, including Miss Asian America, Miss Asian Global, Miss Asian STEM, Miss Asian Talent, Miss Asian Social Media, and Miss Asian Imagine Talks—the latter crown for a woman who raises at least $10,000 in sponsoring and advertising. The winners are expected to appear at a slew of community events, often designed to draw attention to Asian-operated businesses and nonprofits in Asian neighborhoods in the Bay Area. Uchka Jimsee, queen of Miss Asian Global, and two-crown winner Sheila Sun, pose at the after-party banquet at San Francisco\\'s Paramount Superstars restaurant in San Francisco. Jessica Chou But the Bay Area is not known for being a pageant hub like Los Angeles, Dallas, and Atlanta. And as the years go on, MAG delegates are becoming a bit less pageanty. In recent years, half to two-thirds of them have no prior pageant experience, Kong says. These women are not necessarily trying to get on the pageant circuit; they’re searching for something else. “Over here, over here!” Flashes of DSLRs and smartphones popped all over the room. The banquet hall of the Filipino restaurant in South San Francisco was buzzing as local media waited for the presentation of this year’s delegates. Not all the photographers at the press conference appeared professional—a few men brought their cameras to MAG as a hobby; several women tell me they have a code to communicate any discomfort to pageant organizers, should it arise. But the delegates were focused on adapting to their new way of life, where every moment begets a photo opportunity. The delegates were also eager to network. Eranthe Mitome, who owns a milk tea shop in San Jose, wanted exposure to reach future customers. Jaclyn Mariano, who had lost a parent to the war in Iraq, wanted to publicize the nonprofit Gold Star Families. Lily Li wanted to level up her public speaking, in anticipation of a future as a politician. Darae Jun, a PhD candidate in microbiology at UC Berkeley, wanted connections for her future startup. Though pageants are supposedly about beauty, behind the scenes, delegates say physical appearance is only one aspect of a broader package: It’s about confidence, capital (the financial and social kind), and connections. Alongside weeks of training in how to walk and talk, contestants are expected to find sponsors to offset entry fees, attend pageant-related events, and meet friends of friends of friends and business contacts. For some of these women, these ethnic circles serve as a valuable line of support. Betty Hsu, a well-regarded pageant coach based in the Bay Area, tells me many of her clients want help with the glamorous aspects of pageantry because they don’t have a chance to play up their beauty in their work life, where they might be judged as incompetent. The other soft skills she teaches often translate directly to her other clients in the business world. Hsu also consults for engineers turned VCs and people who do corporate finance work. “They need to utilize the life skills that, all the time, we do in the beauty pageant,” she says, like how to walk into a room, how to negotiate with clients, and how to get people to like you. During the press conference, the delegates were called to the stage to introduce themselves. Standing in a line, their collective image was dizzyingly uniform: short scarlet-red cocktail dresses and 4-inch-high nude heels. Although MAG is pan-Asian, most of its contestants throughout the years, including this year, have been East Asian—mostly Chinese. They each came to the mic and presented themselves. Many of them matched their dresses with a bold red lip. After that, the women stepped off the platform and arranged themselves on the dance floor. Meghan Trainor’s song “No Excuses” started to play from the speakers, and they began to move in sync, swaying their arms and sashaying their hips in a choreographed routine. “Have you lost your mind? / Open up your eyes. Huh! / (Someone else) You must have confused me, confused me with (someone else) / You must have confused me, confused me with (someone else) / There ain’t no excuses, excuses, babe … Most of them were aware, to some degree, that with the way they were dolled up and dancing they were playing into the stereotype of the playful pageant girl and the routine fetishization of Asian women. But they weren’t focused on these stereotypes as they danced; they were trying to remember the moves. Sophia Ng, a licensed therapist, told me the caliber of her pageant sisters upended her view that pageants attract ditzes. She had never imagined she would enter a beauty pageant but had heard of erotic capital, a controversial theory popularized by sociologist Catherine Hakim that states that women can gain an advantage over men by using a combination of their looks, liveliness, sex appeal, and social skills to network and get ahead. “If it is my face and how I look that gets my foot in the door, as long as I don’t compromise my values, that’s OK with me,” Ng said. “In any industry, pageant or no pageant, there is a system in place, and there is a way to play the game,” she added.']"
