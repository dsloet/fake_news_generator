He worked for the campaign for 144 days — not 49 days or three and a half months, as Mr. Trump alternately has claimed.\\n\\n(Repetitions in 2018: June 3 | Dec. 28 | Repetitions in 2017: Nov. 5 | Oct. 30).\\n\\n“Now there has been collusion between Hillary Clinton, the D.N.C., and the Russians.”\\n\\nThe Washington Post first reported in October that the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign paid for opposition research that led to a dossier about Mr. Trump compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. Mr. Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of “colluding” with Russia. But it was a conservative website, The Washington Free Beacon, that first paid a research firm for the opposition research. It stopped when Mr. Trump won the nomination. The firm, Fusion GPS, was then paid by the Democrats for the research that became the dossier.\\n\\nThis is misleading.\\n\\nCollusion, which is generally understood as secretive and often illicit collaboration, has no defined legal meaning. Mr. Steele did use Russian sources to compile his dossier, and reported his findings to the F.B.I. But there is no evidence anyone from the Clinton campaign met with Russian officials directly and conspired to manipulate the American election.\\n\\n(Repetitions in 2018: Aug. 14 | Aug. 9 | Aug. 6 | Aug. 6 | Aug. 3 | Aug. 1 | July 31 | July 29 | July 27 | July 7 | June 8 | June 2 | May 17 | April 28 | April 26 | March 25 | March 11 | Feb. 17 | Jan. 11 | Jan. 5 | Repetitions in 2017: Oct. 25)\\n\\n“Nobody asks John Podesta about the company that he has with his brother in Russia.”\\n\\nAs evidence of Democratic collusion, Mr. Trump has said John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign manager, owned a company in Russia.\\n\\nFalse.\\n\\nMr. Podesta does not own a company in Russia. The consulting firm that he and his brother, Tony Podesta, co-founded is based in Washington, not Russia.

Mrs. Clinton was secretary of state when the Obama administration allowed Russia’s nuclear agency to purchase the company. The State Department was one of nine agencies — as well as federal nuclear regulator and a state regulator — that had to sign off on the sale.

       " 'BERLIN — The personal relationship between Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is often boiled down to certain anecdotes: her put-downs about his role in the K.G.B., and his attempts to rattle her by bringing his large black Labrador to a meeting, knowing her fear of dogs.\\n\\nBut the two countries’ long history of alienation and rapprochement was also at play when Ms. Merkel and Mr. Putin sat down for talks on Saturday in the German government’s villa outside Berlin — influencing, and possibly limiting, the outcome of the meeting.\\n\\nBefore talks began, the two leaders addressed reporters, but took no questions. They said stability in Ukraine and Syria and the future of the Iran nuclear deal were the top international issues on their agenda. Bilateral relations focusing on energy and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline would also be discussed, they said.\\n\\n“Germany, but especially Russia, as a member of the U.N.

       " 'He came to be likened in stature to Dag Hammarskjold, the second secretary general, who died in a mysterious plane crash in Africa in 1961. Mr. Annan was credited with revitalizing the United Nations’ institutions, shaping what he called a new “norm of humanitarian intervention,” particularly in places where there was no peace for traditional peacekeepers to keep.\\n\\nAnd, not least, he was lauded for persuading Washington to unblock arrears that had been withheld because of the profound misgivings about the United Nations voiced by American conservatives.\\n\\nHis tenure was rarely free of debate, however. In 1998, Mr. Annan traveled to Baghdad to negotiate directly with Saddam Hussein over the status of United Nations weapons inspections, winning a temporary respite in the long battle of wills with the West but raising questions about his decision to shake hands — and even smoke cigars — with that dictator.\\n\\nIn fact, Mr. Annan called the 2003 invasion of Iraq illegal and suffered an acute personal loss when a trusted and close associate, the Brazilian official Sérgio Vieira de Mello, his representative in Baghdad, died in a suicide truck bombing in August 2003 that struck the United Nations office there, killing many civilians.\\n\\nThe attack prompted complaints that Mr. Annan had not grasped the perils facing his subordinates after the ouster of Mr. Hussein.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nWhile his admirers praised his courtly, charismatic and measured approach, Mr. Annan was hamstrung by the inherent flaw of his position as what many people called a “secular pope” — a figure of moral authority bereft of the means other than persuasion to enforce the high standards he articulated.\\n\\nAs secretary general, Mr. Annan, like all his predecessor and successors, commanded no divisions of troops or independent sources of income. Ultimately, his writ extended only as far as the usually squabbling powers making up the Security Council — the highest U.N. executive body — allowed it to run.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nIn his time, those divisions deepened, reaching a nadir in the invasion of Iraq. Over his objections, the campaign went ahead on the American and British premise that it was meant to disarm the Iraqi regime of chemical weapons, which it did not have or, at least, were never found.\\n\\nIraq also brought embarrassment closer to home when reports began surfacing in 2004 that Mr. Annan’s son, Kojo Annan, worked for Cotecna Inspection Services, a Geneva-based company that had won a lucrative contract in a vast humanitarian program, known as oil for food, that was supervised by the United Nations in Iraq.\\n\\nA commission led by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, concluded that the secretary general had not influenced the awarding of the contract but also that he had not investigated it aggressively once questions were raised.\\n\\nMr. Annan said he took the commission’s findings as exoneration, but his reputation suffered, particularly in the eyes of adversaries in Washington.\\n\\nTimes of Bloodshed\\n\\nIn assessing his broader record, moreover, many critics singled out Mr. Annan’s personal role as head of the United Nations peacekeeping operations from 1993 to 1997 — a period that saw the killing of 18 American service personnel in Somalia in October 1993, the deaths of more than 800,000 Rwandans in the genocide of 1994, and the massacre of 8,000 Bosnian Muslims by Bosnian Serb forces at Srebrenica in 1995.\\n\\nIn Rwanda and Bosnia, United Nations forces drawn from across the organization’s member states were outgunned and showed little resolve. In both cases, troops from Europe were quick to abandon their missions. And in both cases, Mr. Annan was accused of failing to safeguard those who had looked to United Nations soldiers for protection.\\n\\n“Annan felt that the very countries that had turned their backs on the Rwandans and Bosnians were the ones making him their scapegoat,” Samantha Power, an author who became the United States ambassador to the United Nations during the Obama administration, wrote in 2008. “But he knew that his name would appear in the history books beside the two defining genocidal crimes of the second half of the 20th century.”\\n\\nDespite the serial setbacks, Mr. Annan commanded the world stage with ease in his impeccably tailored suits, goatee and slight, graceful physique — attributes that made him and his second wife, Nane Lagergren, a global power couple.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nHe seemed to radiate an aura of probity and authority. “How do we explain Kofi Annan’s enduring moral prestige,” the Canadian author, politician and academic Michael Ignatieff wrote in a review of Mr. Annan’s 2012 memoir, “Interventions: A Life in War and Peace” (with Nader Mousavizadeh), in The New York Review of Books.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\n“Personal charisma is only part of the story,” Mr. Ignatieff wrote. “In addition to his charm, of which there is plenty, there is the authority that comes from experience. Few people have spent so much time around negotiating tables with thugs, warlords and dictators. He has made himself the world’s emissary to the dark side.”\\n\\nThe desire to burnish his legacy seemed to motivate Mr. Annan long after Ban Ki-moon replaced him as secretary general, and he set up a nonprofit foundation to promote higher standards of global governance. In 2008, he headed a commission of eminent Africans that persuaded rival factions in Kenya to reconcile a year after more than 1,000 people were killed during and after disputed elections.\\n\\nIn February 2012, Mr. Annan was appointed as the joint envoy of the Arab League and the United Nations to seek a settlement in Syria as civil war there tightened its grip. But he resigned in frustration that August, citing the intransigence of both sides in a conflict that had convulsed and reshaped the region and claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.\\n\\nKofi Atta Annan was born on April 8, 1938, in the city of Kumasi in what was then Gold Coast and which, in 1957, became Ghana, the first African state to achieve independence from British colonialism. Born into an aristocratic family, he had three sisters, two of them older. The third, Efua, was a twin who died in the 1990s.\\n\\nAfter a spell at the elite Mfantsipim boarding school founded by Methodists, he went on to higher education as an economist in Ghana, at Macalester College in St. Paul, in Geneva, and at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\\n\\nIn 1965, he married Titi Alakija, a woman from a prosperous Nigerian family. The couple had two children, a daughter, Ama, and a son, Kojo. The marriage foundered in the late 1970s.\\n\\nMr. Annan married Ms. Lagergren, a divorced lawyer working at the United Nations, in 1984. She, too, was a scion of a prominent family, a niece of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who protected thousands of Hungarian Jews during World War II but disappeared after being captured by Soviet forces. Ms. Lagergren had a daughter, Nina, from her first marriage. He is survived by Ms. Lagergren and his children.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\nMost of Mr. Annan’s working life was spent in the corridors and conference rooms of the United Nations, but, he told the author Philip Gourevitch in 2003, “I feel profoundly African, my roots are deeply African, and the things I was taught as a child are very important to me.”\\n\\nHis first appointment with a United Nations agency was in 1962, at the World Health Organization in Geneva. Mr. Annan returned briefly to Ghana to promote tourism and worked in Ethiopia with the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa before returning to the health organization’s European headquarters.\\n\\nPhoto\\n\\nPeacekeeper in Chief\\n\\nLater, in New York, he worked in senior human resources and budgetary positions until, in the early 1990s, the secretary general at the time, Boutros Boutros Ghali of Egypt, appointed him first as deputy and then as head of peacekeeping operations.\\n\\nThe appointment plunged Mr. Annan into a maelstrom of conflicts in which United Nations forces were deployed. As genocide approached Rwanda in 1994 — months after the downing of a Black Hawk helicopter in Mogadishu, Somalia, and the killing of American service personnel — the Clinton administration in Washington had little appetite for intervention.\\n\\nBut on the ground, the Canadian commander, Lt. Gen. Roméo Dallaire, heading a modest force of 2,500 United Nations troops, sought permission from Mr. Annan’s office to raid an arms cache that he believed would be used in massacres. Permission was refused. Only years later, after the release of a critical report in 1999, did Mr. Annan declare that “all of us must bitterly regret that we did not do more to prevent it.”\\n\\n“On behalf of the United Nations, I acknowledge this failure and express my deep remorse,” he said.\\n\\nIn Bosnia, too, the United Nations was accused of being overcautious. Critics said it had been restricted by a mandate, approved by the Security Council, for the establishment of so-called safe havens under United Nations protection that proved, in Srebrenica, to be illusory. European powers opposed airstrikes to halt the advancing Bosnian Serbs, who overran Srebrenica despite the presence of peacekeeping troops from the Netherlands.\\n\\nLater that year, Mr. Annan seemed to adopt a tougher line, approving the NATO bombing campaign that forced Serbia to the negotiating table to sign the Dayton peace accords, so named because the negotiations had taken place at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. At that time, airstrikes required a so-called dual key approval of the NATO command and the United Nations.\\n\\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\\n\\n“When Kofi turned it,” Richard C. Holbrooke, the former American envoy, told Mr. Gourevitch, “he became secretary general in waiting.”\\n\\nWith Washington pressing for the ouster of Mr. Boutros Ghali, Mr. Annan took office as secretary general with American approval on Jan. 1, 1997.\\n\\nHe was, Ms. Power wrote, “the primary guardian of the U.N. rule book,” which insisted on the primacy of the Security Council as “the sole source of legitimacy,” in Mr. Annan’s words, in approving overseas interventions. Those rules were flouted by NATO in March 1999, with its bombing of the former Yugoslavia, forcing Mr. Annan to seek a middle ground.\\n\\n“It is, indeed, tragic that diplomacy has failed,” he said on the first day of NATO bombing, choosing words that largely defined the dilemmas confronting policymakers throughout and beyond his tenure, “but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace.”\\n\\n“We will not, and we cannot accept a situation where people are brutalized behind national boundaries,” he continued later as the 78-day aerial campaign ended its second week of efforts to halt a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.\\n\\n“For at the end of the 20th century, one thing is clear: A United Nations that will not stand up for human rights is a United Nations that cannot stand up for itself.”',\n",

       " 'What the relationship between Mr. Reitman and Professor Ronell illuminates most clearly is the obsessive and overwhelming role an adviser can have in the life of a graduate student, especially, perhaps, in the humanities, where a job market that has been contracting for nearly two decades often leaves students feeling entirely reliant on those advisers to help them get them tenure-track positions.\\n\\nMr. Reitman has had three prestigious fellowships since he finished his Ph.D., the current one nonpaying, but fellowships are default positions for people who don’t get jobs. Mr. Reitman, in fact, received not a single offer from the 20 schools to which he applied for teaching positions. Whether this has to do with the complicated nature of his relationship to Professor Ronell, who he claims sent letters of recommendations on his behalf that were all too tepid and never pushed for him anywhere, the realities of a depressed academic market, or deficiency on his part, is hard to know.\\n\\nWhatever the truth, these letters of recommendation hold far more importance than they do in other professional fields. A letter for a young academic specializing in 17th-century Portuguese history, for example, must make a case for that candidate’s exceptionalism in relation to the competing candidates in the field. If it cannot do that, the prospects can be nonexistent.\\n\\n“This sense of dependency that a student has on an adviser is a holdover from the medieval roots of academia, when the student is in the thrall of the master,” Leonard Cassuto, an English professor at Fordham University who has written extensively about the challenges of modern graduate schools, told me. When the student is in the hands of a star who commands great authority over the world of a rarefied discipline, the dynamic of the worshiper and the worshiped can seem immutable.\\n\\nBoth the Title IX report from N.Y.U. and a lawsuit that Mr. Reitman filed this week against the university and Professor Ronell, as well as a statement that she issued on Thursday evening in response, include floridly worded communications between the two that suggest an unusually intense relationship. The emails and texts included in Mr. Reitman’s complaint depict a needy woman making demands on his time: “I was crying when I did not hear back from you. It was a hard night,” read one. Or: “I am on a need to hear from you basis, please don’t refrain much longer!”\\n\\nProfessor Ronell, who denies all allegations of harassment and assault and stalking, provided excerpts from emails in her statement which are meant to demonstrate Mr. Reitman’s devotion: “Sweet Beloved, I was so happy to see you tonight, and spend time together. It was so magical and important, crucial on [sic] so many ways. Our shared intimacy was a glorious cadence to our time in Berlin.”\\n\\nYet as ardent as his emails seem, almost all of them, she maintains, included a request to review and edit his writing.',\n",

The area has long been a magnet for surfers and hippies, but in the past decade — as the term “ boho-chic ” has emerged as a moneyed alternative to its scruffier precursors — Byron has transformed. It is now a place where movie stars own homes and $300 caftans are the new norm, alongside crystals and patchouli.\\n\\nFor a talented chef, the allure of Byron is obvious. The influx of money, brought by people looking for a certain beachy lifestyle guided by good taste, is sure to provide a decent customer base, as is the beach tourism and the many music and cultural festivals held in the area.\\n\\nBut Byron itself is at a crossroads, one in which the property values have skyrocketed while the infrastructure falters under the town’s growing popularity. It’s as if Byron skipped over the part in its evolution where it was exciting enough to draw inventive operators but affordable enough to create opportunity for those people.\\n\\nAnd so, a few enterprising people took a bet on the small towns surrounding Byron. This pioneering spirit has resulted in rapid gentrification. It has also created a thriving dining scene that’s one of the Australia’s most interesting and fertile, rivaled only by Tasmania’s.',\n",

       " 'This summer, for the second year in a row, we selected poems by six poets and presented each one to a different photographer. Their challenge was to interpret the poetry in images. This assignment was about freedom; we wanted photographers to find inspiration in language — a single word, a phrase, the rhythm of verse.\\n\\nAnd so they did. In these poems our photographers felt the passing of time. The everyday. The power and fury of nature.\\n\\n[See all of the poems and photos here.]\\n\\nA poem is personal. Its meaning can shift as a reader changes and grows. One of our photographers felt a connection to the poem she read right away. Another felt conflicted; while some words and phrases felt familiar to her, she was resistant to others. All of the photographers immersed themselves in the poetry. “I read the poem aloud to several people over the course of the two weeks I worked on this project,” writes Anjali Pinto. “My sister and I spoke about it on a long car ride and that’s when the meaning shifted for me.”\\n\\nOne theme that arises throughout this work is collaboration. Maddie McGarvey and Annie Flanagan worked together to shoot a series of composite images, exploring the ways in which people might feel confined by their bodies and society. Nydia Blas worked with a group of teenagers in Ithaca, N.Y., to create what she calls a “disjointed magical narrative.” And Cig Harvey photographed her daughter, both a subject and a collaborator.',\n",

Nixon mostly without publicly criticizing the political conduct of a sitting commander in chief — until now.\\n\\n“We have never before seen the approval or removal of security clearances used as a political tool, as was done in this case.”\\n\\nThey rebuked Mr. Trump for revoking the security clearance of John Brennan, the C.I.A. director under President Obama, in retaliation for his scalding condemnations and, ominously, for his role in “the rigged witch hunt” — the investigation into Russia’s attempt to fix the 2016 election, now in the hands of Robert S.

       " 'There are about 30 million deer in the lower 48 states, 47 million ducks, a million elk, and 15 million pheasants, and they produce offspring annually and from a young age. Compare that with a female grizzly, who doesn’t have cubs until she’s between 3 and 8, and may keep her cubs for up to three years. It’s no surprise that more than 40 years after grizzlies were protected in the lower 48, there are still only about 1,800 of them roaming the West.\\n\\nOf course, the notion of “protection” needs to be put in context: nearly five dozen grizzlies died here last year: in vehicle collisions and unexpected encounters with humans, as well as from natural causes and intentional shootings for property damage, aggressive behavior or attacks on livestock. (Bear 610 may have become a casualty. There have been no confirmed sightings of her this year.) Despite these sobering statistics, and numerous independent biologists expressing concern over the future of the grizzly bear, Wyoming is planning to move ahead with the hunt.\\n\\n“I trust the scientific experts at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department to manage bears in a way that ensures they never require federal protection again,” Wyoming’s governor, Matt Mead, said earlier this summer.\\n\\nBut this hunt is neither about managing a wildlife population that has exceeded the carrying capacity of its habitat, nor about putting healthy food on the table. Instead, this hunt is about what the great conservationist and thoughtful hunter Aldo Leopold, called a “certificate” — a trophy proving that it’s owner has “been somewhere and done something.”\\n\\nIn the case of killing a grizzly, it means you’ve done something that has been considered difficult and dangerous. And it was, when you were hunting with a spear. But anyone who has shot a high-powered rifle knows that knocking off a grizzly bear is no more than an exercise in marksmanship, like shooting an elk. The difference is, you eat the elk.\\n\\nGrizzly bears are not hunted for their meat. Wyoming’s hunting regulations make this clear. If you shoot what’s called a “big game animal” in Wyoming, like an elk, a deer or an antelope, you’re legally bound to bring all the edible portions of the animal out of the field. But if you shoot what’s called “a trophy animal,” like a mountain lion, a black bear and, now, a grizzly, all you have to bring out is its skull and pelt.\\n\\nSome wildlife managers argue that we should nonetheless hunt grizzlies to keep them wary of people and reduce human-bear conflicts , an argument that sounds similar to saying that police should randomly kill teenagers to reduce school shootings. No one discounts the potential danger that grizzlies pose, and the wise hiker ventures into bear country armed with pepper spray. But why not remove these infrequent problem bears on a case-by-case basis rather than using hunting as a blind form of wildlife management?\\n\\nUnfortunately, these arguments often fall on deaf ears in Wyoming, where some otherwise-smart politicians continue to claim, at least in private, that we should hunt grizzly bears because “here in Wyoming, it’s our culture to shoot animals.” We can only hope that the federal judge hearing the challenge to the delisting, Judge Dana Christensen, makes a stab at changing that culture, before 20 or so scarce grizzlies, including perhaps 399 and 610, are made into rugs.\\n\\nTed Kerasote is a writer and the author, most recently, of “Pukka’s Promise: The Quest for Longer-Lived Dogs.”\\n\\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTopinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.',\n",

It’s who I am!\\n\\nI can tread water for up to two minutes. I can make it to three minutes on a good day, given that I have not eaten a cheeseburger in the past hour. If you need me to do this to cross a moat into a castle or whatever, let me know ahead of time because there’s always a good chance I’ve eaten a cheeseburger.\\n\\nThough I am not qualified to be the team’s hacker, I did take calculus in high school and passed the AP exam.

I’m already wealthy and glorified, and have a chemical imbalance that gives me constant adrenaline-based migraines. I want in because I am terrible at everything else I’ve tried and, consequently, am deeply bored with my life.\\n\\nIf you need to reach me, I’ll be at the coffee shop on Fulton Street, sitting at the booth near Tad but not too close because that would be obvious, and I am good at being secretive.

I didn’t have to explain my strange new self to them. We were all obsessed with our babies. We were all overwhelmed. If one of us started crying for no reason, the others just passed her a tissue and kept talking.\\n\\nI trust these women more than anyone. We take advice from each other before doctors or parenting books. We often make different decisions for our children, and yet there is never a hint of judgment. As we’ve found our footing, our conversations have moved to topics beyond babies. There’s a built-in intimacy there, and so it feels natural to talk about other important life events too. I hope it worked out this way for those women I eavesdropped on at Le Pain Quotidien. Maybe by now they’re all getting some sleep, and they joke about the time nobody could remember Kate’s name.\\n\\nA friend told me recently that she still talks every day to the mothers she leaned on when their now-10-year-olds were newborns. Some of them, she said, were people she knew beforehand, but this shared life event, unlike any other, accelerated their bond. I thought then of Steph, who introduced Cathy and me. She was only a casual acquaintance until we connected over being pregnant. She was so generous with her knowledge and time. She sent an enormous spreadsheet detailing all the things I needed to do and plan and buy before the baby came. Our friendship was solidified when I asked her what the frozen maxi pads on the list were for, and she calmly explained in great detail.\\n\\nSteph continues to play this role for Cathy and me. To a new mother, a woman with a child a few months older than yours is a prophet.

       " 'What’s disturbing is the way the possibility of a tape has been held up — through a week packed with breaking news chyrons and cable news panels somberly weighing in on its potential impact — as a potential game changer when it comes to the national consensus about Mr. Trump’s racism. This intense attention to the story seems to reflect the misguided belief that the ultimate, objective proof of racism is a person’s use of a slur. The popularity of that belief is a reminder that a facet of white supremacy is not only to decide what race is but also what racism is — and when it does or does not exist.\\n\\nI worry about those who seem to believe Mr. Trump is not really racist without the tape — and, perhaps, that the nation is not racist without Mr. Trump. I worry that people want to believe this.\\n\\nTo think of a racial slur as the ultimate in racism is naïve at best. As President Barack Obama said of racism in 2015: “We are not cured of it. And it’s not just a matter of it not being polite to say ‘nigger’ in public. That’s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not.” Racism’s harm comes less from single words and individual expressions of animosity than it does from systemic realities — such as how one in nine black children have a parent in prison compared with one in 57 white children.\\n\\nIts harm comes from the actions of people like Mr. Trump, who when he was a landlord was sued by the Department of Justice for anti-black housing discrimination. Who in the 1980s took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the execution of “muggers and murderers” — a reference to the Central Park Five. Who still insisted, in 2016, that those black and Latino men were guilty despite DNA evidence that exonerated them. Who falsely suggested that the first African-American president was born in Kenya and demanded that he produce his birth certificate.\\n\\nImage A full-page newspaper ad taken out by Donald Trump in 1989 in The New York Times, calling for a return of the death penalty after the Central Park jogger case.\\n\\nMr. Trump has tweeted, “I don’t have that word in my vocabulary.” There is little reason to believe that statement, because he is a well-documented liar. But even if this is true, it does nothing to erase the many ways he’s expressed his racism — and in particular, his anti-blackness. Calling majority-black nations “shithole countries.” Spreading the lie that immigrants are more likely to commit crimes (they’re not) and that Mexicans are rapists (on tape!). Wishing for more Norwegian immigrants, and railing against how immigration is “changing the culture” of Europe.',\n",

So why are Senate Republicans so afraid of letting Americans learn more about him?\\n\\nAfter what they did to Judge Merrick Garland in 2016 — obliterating Senate tradition by outright ignoring President Barack Obama’s third Supreme Court nomination for partisan political gain — you might think it would be hard for Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to inflict any more damage on the court.\\n\\nSurprise! They’re now running the most secretive and incomplete confirmation process in modern history. They scrambled to set the start of Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing for Sept. 4, even as they have refused multiple requests by their Democratic colleagues to see more than one million documents covering his years as White House staff secretary to President George W. Bush. Judge Kavanaugh has called that job, which he held from 2003 to 2006, “the most interesting and informative” of his career in terms of preparing for his work on the bench.\\n\\nThese documents could contain important information about his role in some of the Bush administration’s most controversial actions, including its warrantless wiretapping program and its torture policy. Judge Kavanaugh was evasive during his 2006 confirmation hearing for a seat on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where he currently sits. He denied any involvement in those policies, but Democratic senators have long believed that his answers to them were, at best, misleading.

And it was particularly rich coming from someone whose own campaign slogan, from 2010, was, “Together, we can make New York great again.”\\n\\nBut it’s also a statement more than a few people agree with, not least among progressives Cuomo is trying to woo in his primary campaign against challenger Cynthia Nixon. So it’s worth reminding ourselves of just what it is that really makes America great.',\n",
       " 'Since the late 1990s, reducing animal shelter populations through adoption has been a prime piece in the “no kill” strategy. Shelter hours have been extended to accommodate working people in the hopes they’ll visit and find a pet. Volunteers and staff members post cute photos and videos online; supervised dog “play groups” let would-be adopters see animals happily romping together, rather than caged and lunging at the bars. Thousands of independent rescue groups of all sizes have taken custody of shelter animals; they have fostered, groomed, spayed and neutered them, medically treated and trained them, and found them homes.\\n\\nAll of this is a good thing. The problem is that while regions like New England and the Pacific Northwest report shortages of shelter animals, nationwide it’s a different story. Because of the continued high intake volume in many states, the United States still euthanizes up to two million dogs and cats a year, with rates highest in disadvantaged communities. Not coincidentally, shelter intake is higher in those communities as well.\\n\\nTake parts of Los Angeles, which has had an explicit no-kill policy for its shelters since 2012. At the moment, every public shelter in the city is full, and the South Los Angeles shelter, in one of the most densely populated and disadvantaged parts of town, has been crowded for months, with dogs being housed two and three to a cage.\\n\\nA big part of the reason shelters fill is poverty: An estimated one-quarter of shelter animals are there after their owners have surrendered them because of family dysfunction or financial pressure. A dog may be sick and there’s no money for a vet; a landlord may be threatening eviction. The animals of the poor end up in shelters even when their owners desperately want to keep them. If a dog gets out and is picked up by animal control, for instance, impound and reclamation fees and fines can make retrieving it unaffordable. Ignorance and misinformation about sterilization, and not enough affordable, easily available surgery options, result in even more dogs that no one can care for.\\n\\nAdoption promotion and events like low-price giveaways address none of these issues and can create problems of their own by enabling abusers and, far more commonly, impulse buyers. Adoption becomes a feel-good “numbers” game, in which we carefully and proudly track only how many animals have left the shelter. No one notes how many of them end up back in the system. The head of a well-established rescue group told me that just days after a “clear the shelters” event, she saw three recently adopted dogs being returned to two Los Angeles-area shelters. “The adopters had ‘changed their minds,’” she said. Indeed, no one knows how any of these animals fare at all. A longtime Los Angeles shelter volunteer observed that “had Valerie not come across the path of the Ghetto Rescue people, no one would even know her story.”',\n",

       " 'For Rimsky-Korsakov (1844-1908), shame was both a spur and a block. As an inferiority complex vis-à-vis Western culture, it played an important role for him and others who sought a national style in Russian music. Hallmarks of the movement were an emphasis on Slavic folk traditions; exotic flavors, invented or borrowed from the southern fringes of the Russian empire; and a deep-seated suspicion of expertise as a vehicle for cosmopolitan — today one might say globalist — dilution of national identity.\\n\\nThat wariness of specialists was convenient, since most of the leading composers in this loose group were army men, landowners or, in the case of Alexander Borodin, scientists: in another word, amateurs. Intuition, rather than technique, was their guiding compositional process; melody was king, and awkwardness a sign of authenticity. Borodin’s String Quartet No. 2, which received a burnished reading by the Parker Quartet on Saturday, is an example of the lyricism and freshness this approach could produce, but also demonstrates its stretches of harmonic helplessness.\\n\\nIn 1867, the critic Vladimir Stasov appealed to public sympathies for the local underdogs in a rave review of a Pan-Slavic concert when he invoked divine protection for “this mighty little handful of Russian composers” — a term that stuck. Also translated as the Mighty Bunch or the Mighty Five, it came to describe the circle which included (but was not limited to) the composers César Cui, Mily Balakirev and Modest Mussorgsky as well as Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin.\\n\\nBut shame of a personal kind propelled Rimsky-Korsakov to break with their principles. In 1871, he accepted a professorship at the fledgling St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he found himself having to teach fundamentals of music theory he barely understood. “I was a dilettante and knew nothing,” he later wrote in his autobiography.',\n",

Her father let the world know, in spirited remarks on her 1972 album, “Amazing Grace,” that his daughter “never really left the church.” And clearly it had never left her.\\n\\nDuring her remarkable career, Ms. Franklin made sure to incorporate her concern for social justice and redemptive politics as she performed at civil rights fund-raisers for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s and to benefit the efforts of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. She offered to post bond for the jailed revolutionary Angela Davis in the early ’70s, going against the wishes of her father. In her statement at the time she said: “I’ve been locked up (for disturbing the peace in Detroit) and I know you got to disturb the peace when you can’t get no peace.”\\n\\nAdorned in a spectacular hat, Ms. Franklin famously sang “My Country ’Tis of Thee” at the first inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009.\\n\\nI was blessed to know Aretha Franklin personally, and she would sometimes call me to discuss current events. She had a crisp comprehension of the political machinations of our time. She reveled in the achievements of the first black president and registered grief at the polarization under his successor.\\n\\nHer sense of humor was sharp. I cracked up each time she recalled how Dr. King, as a guest in her father’s home, encountered the family maid one morning who laid out the options for breakfast. “There are scrambled eggs, and grits, and soychig,” Ms. Franklin recalled the maid saying. Having discerned that she was offering her unique pronunciation of sausage, Dr. King, without missing a beat, replied that he’d have the eggs and grits, “and some of that soychig.” We both laughed until tears streamed down our faces.\\n\\nI hungered for personal knowledge of her father’s artistry on the pulpit. My close study of his craft led Ms. Franklin to invite me on stage with her in Atlanta in 2012 to offer an appreciation for his formidable oratorical talents. She took great pride in her father’s command of black sacred speech, and she was especially grateful that a younger generation took note of his epic gifts.\\n\\nAs we stood on stage, we both realized, as we remarked later, that we were a long way from Detroit. We both fiercely loved Detroit, and Detroit, in turn, was exceedingly proud of her. She was a fearless evangelist for a city that was often spurned for its embrace of unapologetic black identity and leadership.',\n",

Experimental designs for autonomous cars incorporate as many as 16 video cameras, 12 radar sensors, half a dozen ultrasonic sensors, and four or five lidar sensors.

Mr. Bauer cited what has become a mantra among autonomous vehicle engineers: Self-driving cars will generate 4 terabytes of data per hour. That includes live information about road conditions, weather, objects around them, traffic and street signs — all of which has to be shared among components in the car and used to make split-second driving decisions.\\n\\nAutomakers are aware of the coming data tsunami.\\n\\n“They think we need 300 teraflops of computing power,” said Willard Tu, a senior director at chip supplier Xilinx. A teraflop is a trillion operations per second, which means that every vehicle would be a rolling supercomputer. “So the type of pipe and the diameter of that pipe” that is going to connect all these components, Mr. Tu said, “has to be very flexible.” Estimates for how big that pipe needs to be range from 25 to 40 or more gigabytes per second.\\n\\nThe catch? “No one’s solved the problem of how do I stream all that data to the central processor?” said Mr. Tu.\\n\\nWhile engineers and automakers agree that today’s cars need to be completely rewired, the question for many is, with what?\\n\\nEliminating the cables entirely by using a short-distance wireless system would be the easiest way to bridge the gap.

They are getting married. They’re not having a ‘gay wedding.’ They’re having a wedding. You don’t go to a straight wedding and say, ‘I’m so happy to be at this straight wedding.’”\\n\\nWith the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States in 2015, weddings among the L.G.B.T.Q. community have been on the rise. Nearly 3 percent of all weddings in the country are for a same-sex couple, according to the Wedding Report, a research company based in Tucson.

The qualifier to describe the wedding signals that it’s unlike a wedding of a heterosexual couple. It feels exclusive. While the party may have untraditional details, it’s a legal marriage like any between a man and a woman. A same-sex couple and a straight couple both say the required vows and sign the same marriage license to be recognized as legally wed.',\n",

We turned and sprinted back into the trees the way we’d come.\\n\\nIn the pounding of our footsteps, below the wild panic, I remember a distinct thrill of pleasure. Not in a suicidal sense (I was too frightened to look back, and certainly didn’t want to feel the bear’s jaws on my neck), but as a matter of perspective. The feeling was tied most closely to relief. Every other thing I’d been worrying about that day, from whether I’d worn enough sunscreen to whether my partner really loved me, fell aside. I had one concern: to get us away without being eaten.\\n\\nCivilization itself is an attempt to protect us from this feeling. From its earliest iterations in fire-starting and cave-dwelling to its current zenith in the construction of megalopolises, as well as the careful documentation of every birth and the methodical laying bare of each strand in every helix, civilization is a way of setting ourselves apart from the prey we once were. Building walls, both physical and informational, to keep out the bears.\\n\\nYet even atop the highest tower in the most prestigious university we remain animals, directed by the same base-level needs and emotions that motivate living creatures from bonobos to rats.

She’s been displaying increasingly aggressive behavior.” I hardly noticed the fact that he seemed to know this particular bear intimately (I’d later learn that rangers track many of the grizzlies in the park), and instead had the strange image of my own grandmother in her last days, hunting game with desperate, bloody abandon, rather than living in the guest room of our house.',\n",

       " 'Photo illustration by Jens Mortensen for The New York Times\\n\\nDigital assistants like Amazon’s Echo can listen to you. And they can talk back. But that doesn’t mean they can carry on a good conversation.\\n\\nAs the devices that run these assistants become more commonplace — 39 million Americans now own one, according to a recent study — Amazon and competitors like Apple and Google foresee a day when you can chat with their assistants like you would with a friend.\\n\\nWe explored the conversational limits of the leading assistants. After consulting with the companies involved and a few artificial intelligence experts we created tests that show what they can and can’t handle. Don’t expect the assistants to replace conversations with friends anytime soon. But the experiments — even in the moments when the assistants screwed up — showed what these assistants could one day become in our lives.\\n\\nLet’s make a list Because these devices are not yet nimble enough to understand and respond to anything you might say, Amazon, Apple, and Google must hone them for particular tasks, like playing a song or building a shopping list. If you stick to these tasks, the devices are pretty good at zeroing on what you want. But even inside these small domains, they can trip up. Listen how. Add these things to my shopping list… Amazon Echo What can I add for you? Apple Homepod I added “these things” to the shopping list. Google Home What do you want to add? Right away, the HomePod showed how difficult it can be for machines to understand natural language. The device recognized what we were doing, but misunderstood how we wanted to do it, and added an item called “these things” to a shopping list. … guacamole, chips, tortillas. Amazon Echo “Guacamole chips tortillas” added to your shopping list. Apple Homepod No longer listening. Google Home OK, I’ve added “guacamole” and “chips tortillas” to your shopping list. If your roommate asked what you wanted from the market and you said “guacamole, chips, tortillas,” he would understand that as three separate things. But the Google and Amazon devices didn’t quite recognize the pause between items as a verbal comma. Although these devices are pretty good at recognizing what you say, they may not completely understand it. Also add olive oil. Amazon Echo I’ve put “olive oil” on your shopping list. Apple Homepod OK, I added “olive oil” to the Reminders. Google Home Sorry, I’m not sure how to help. Alexa grasped that we were continuing to add to the shopping list, even though we weren’t explicit about it. It held onto the context of the exchange and mapped our next request back to our list.\\n\\nA digital assistant relies on many different technology systems, all working together on the device and inside a network of computer data centers that connect to the assistant over the internet.\\n\\nWhen you say something, one system tries to recognize each word and convert it to text. Another system tries to understand the meaning of each word and how it relates to the others. A third system spits out new text that responds to what you’ve said. A fourth converts this response to digital speech. Other systems may also weigh in, but you get the point.\\n\\nEngineers used to build speech recognition systems by writing one small computing rule at a time — a painstaking process. But so-called neural networks are now replacing those hand-written rules, accelerating the progress of speech recognition. Neural networks are complex mathematical systems that can learn particular tasks by pinpointing patterns in large amounts of data. They can learn to recognize spoken words, for instance, by analyzing recordings of old customer support calls.\\n\\nIn some cases, the assistants perform as well as human listeners. But listening is only part of what they do.\\n\\nResolving ambiguity Even if you make a rather specific request, it can have multiple meanings. And that can be tough for an assistant to deal with. Who won the Giants game last night? Amazon Echo On December 31st, the Giants beat the Redskins 18 to 10. They’ll play on August 9th at 7 p.m. at home against the Browns. Apple Homepod Which Giants? New York Giants, or San Francisco Giants? Google Home Yesterday, the Giants played the Padres. The final score was 3 to 2, Giants, in zero innings. If you’re a sports fan, you know there are two professional teams that call themselves the Giants. If someone asks about a Giants game in the summer, you know they’re talking about the San Francisco Giants, who play baseball. When we asked on August 2, before pre-season football started, Google Home came to the same conclusion. And the HomePod asked that we identify the team we were talking about. Google and Apple likely have written an explicit rule for this particular situation. Alexa guessed that we meant the New York Giants football team, which hadn’t played a game in seven months, but this may have been because we were asking the question in New York. Amazon sometimes generates responses based on your location. In any case, Alexa figured out which team we meant after the next question. Who do they play next? Amazon Echo First pitch of the N.L. West matchup between the Giants and the Diamondbacks is scheduled for tomorrow night at 9:40 p.m. This season, the Giants have bested the Diamondbacks in seven of the 12 games they’ve played. Apple Homepod The Giants battle the Diamondbacks tomorrow at 9:40 p.m. Google Home Their next game is tomorrow at 9:40 p.m., when they will play the Diamondbacks. When you chat with a friend, you use pronouns. To keep up, a digital assistant must recognize pronouns for what they are and map them back to words in a previous exchange. Algorithms are learning to identify pronouns by analyzing hundreds of sentences, detecting patterns in the syntax.\\n\\nAfter recognizing what you say, these devices must then understand what you want and generate a response. For that part, companies like Amazon and Google have also begun to rely on neural networks to learn from what people have asked these digital assistants in the past.\\n\\nEngineers might train one neural network to identify what you are trying to do (build a shopping list, get the score of a baseball game) and train another to parse a sentence and identify the nouns, pronouns, verbs and other parts of speech. It’s like elementary school grammar classes for computers.\\n\\nAll of the machine learning algorithms these devices use are liable to make mistakes, though, and the system can be brittle because so many different algorithms are trying to work in concert. A digital assistant may screw up if you make a small change to a request that has worked countless times in the past. It may also screw up if you don’t change anything.\\n\\nMachine learning algorithms can help these devices deal with turn-by-turn exchanges. But each verbal exchange is limited to a simple, three- or four-turn conversation. In a perfect world, engineers would build one giant neural network that learns to do everything. For now, these devices move toward better conversations in small steps.\\n\\n“If you keep your language short and simple, you can maybe go as deep as three steps,” said Nancy Fulda, a researcher at Brigham Young University who specializes in conversational systems. “The technology operates by different rules than people do.”\\n\\nUnderstanding subtext In the previous example, the devices understood what we were asking because they mapped a pronoun back to the subject of our previous request. But what if we don’t use a pronoun? Where is the nearest coffee shop? Amazon Echo Here are a few popular ones: Ramini Espresso Bar & Cafe, Best Bagel and Coffee, Paris Baguette and Cafe Grumpy. Check out the Alexa app for contact info and hours. Apple Homepod The nearest one I found is Bluestone Lane, located quite close to you on Times Square, which averages four stars according to Yelp. It’s open today, from 6:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Google Home The address for Culture Espresso is 307 West 38th Street, New York, New York, 10018. The devices correctly identified nearby shops, but they were all different. That’s likely because each device is using a different “knowledge graph,” a vast database of facts and other information you may ask for. Google, for example, may use data gathered from Google Maps, whereas the other companies may pull from sources like Yelp. Give me directions. Amazon Echo At the moment, traffic to Ramini Espresso Bar & Cafe at 265 W. 37th Street looks a little sluggish. The fastest route takes about six minutes via W. 42nd Street and 7th Avenue. Apple Homepod I can’t help with directions here. Sorry about that. Google Home The best way to get to Culture Espresso by car is via West 39th Street, and will take about nine minutes in heavy traffic. Amazon trains neural networks to recognize that this kind of pronoun-free request refers back to the previous exchange. The algorithms analyze hundreds, perhaps thousands, of requests like this and learns to identify them on its own. When generating responses, these assistants plug particular information into an existing template. Sometimes, engineers will build this template to sound more conversational. This seemed to be the case here, when Alexa said that traffic was “sluggish.”\\n\\nA neural network also drives Google’s new “conversational mode.”\\n\\nIn the past, you couldn’t talk to the device without saying “Hey, Google.” Now, after saying this once, you can deliver multiple commands and questions. In some cases, Google Home can recognize when you are delivering another command — and when you’re just talking to someone else in the room. It does this with a system that has been “trained” with the interactions other people have had with their devices.

The Boston University endocrinologist, who perhaps more than anyone else is responsible for creating a billion-dollar vitamin D sales and testing juggernaut, elevates his own levels of the stuff with supplements and fortified milk. When he bikes outdoors, he won’t put sunscreen on his limbs. He has written book-length odes to vitamin D, and has warned in multiple scholarly articles about a “vitamin D deficiency pandemic” that explains disease and suboptimal health across the world.\\n\\nHis fixation is so intense that it extends to the dinosaurs. What if the real problem with that asteroid 65 million years ago wasn’t a lack of food, but the weak bones that follow a lack of sunlight? “I sometimes wonder,” Dr. Holick has written, “did the dinosaurs die of rickets and osteomalacia?”\\n\\nDr. Holick’s role in drafting national vitamin D guidelines, and the embrace of his message by mainstream doctors and wellness gurus alike, have helped push supplement sales to $936 million in 2017. That’s a ninefold increase over the previous decade. Lab tests for vitamin D deficiency have spiked, too: Doctors ordered more than 10 million for Medicare patients in 2016, up 547 percent since 2007, at a cost of $365 million.\\n\\nBut few of the Americans swept up in the vitamin D craze are likely aware that the industry has sent a lot of money Dr. Holick’s way.

       " 'This arrangement doesn’t tell you amazement has taken place. It becomes the amazement. Franklin’s Jesus wails for Lazarus to hear him, her voice a whip in one syllable and a caress in the next — religion itself! As Jesus strains through the impossible — Laaaaaaaaaaaazarus! Oh yeah! — giving life to the dead, two women separate from the choral multitude and ululate with awe, gently, soulfully, as if they’re about to pass out. This isn’t a moment you want to encounter in a vulnerable spot. I heard it jaywalking once, and actually stopped in the middle of the street, about to faint with disbelief. Who succeeds at upstaging a biblical miracle with a musical one? And yet it’s not only pious. Franklin’s reverence can wink: “He got up walking like a natural man. Oh, yes, he did,” she sings, yanking Lazarus out of death and into one of her hits.\\n\\nBy this point, the bristling has long given way to Baptist stirring. People are hollering. At Aretha Franklin. In a church. (That until the 1960s was a movie theater.) They’re telling her to go on. They’re prodding her to keep them exhilarated, praising her praising the Lord. We’re not in New Temple Missionary, and yet: Aren’t we? You can hear each guitar plink, each bongo spank. You can practically smell myrrh wafting from the organ. This isn’t happenstance. It’s engineering. Franklin had reconstructed these songs. This one moves at the same pace as the Caravans’, but it’s got more dimensions, more heft.\\n\\nThe entire album is a feat of witty, hooky arrangements, of mischief, ecstasy and bass. The repeated running together of the word “everything” on “What a Friend We Have in Jesus” really is everything. The gospel claps there and on “How I Got Over” (and everywhere else, really) are castanet clear. And “Wholy Holy” is such a celestial R&B achievement that the second-best place to experience it, after a black church, is the nearest planetarium.\\n\\nSo much of the experience listening to music — gospel and otherwise — is feeling it, catching the spirit. “Amazing Grace” is a church full of people’s spirits getting caught, over and over — by Aretha. A movie exists of these two days. Why no one’s seen it is a long story, mainly involving Franklin’s own wishes. But the audio experience has always been cinema enough. How do you hear people going crazy as she unfurls the song “Amazing Grace” and not assume that she’s levitating, that she’s levitating them.\\n\\nThe whoops and hollers are as crucial to the glory of this album as Franklin, the choir and the band. She is but the centerpiece around which a lively stained-glass scene is built — the stirrer and the stirred. Franklin alone with a piano would have sufficed. But she swings for a more radical gospel music that weds emotional might to musical muscle. Her going for the max maxes you out. This is what virtuosity should do — leave you knock-kneed, perform the unthinkable. Maybe Mary shouldn’t weep. But you and I are a different story.',\n",

It doesn’t matter if the song is up-tempo or a ballad — the range and depth of her catalog makes it a rich resource for directors. To invoke one of her beloved hits for a scene — the soft passion of “I Say a Little Prayer,” the aching heartbreak of “Ain’t No Way” or the thundering spirit of “Respect,” just to name a few — is to call upon the Queen to carry the weight of the moment. And there have been many onscreen moments heightened by her singular voice.\\n\\nIn “Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins’s Oscar-winning drama, “One Step Ahead” appears twice — as Mr. Jenkins himself has noted, it’s the only song repeated — and the stirring melancholy of the track fits both scenes beautifully. The first time, it’s heard when Little (Alex Hibbert), a young boy, returns home to his neglectful mother, who is entertaining a man. The lyrics “I’m only one step ahead of heartbreak” underlie the isolation Little feels as his mother and the man barely acknowledge him, leaving him alone in the living room.',\n",

But Ms. Franklin had a resurgence in the 1980s with her album “Who’s Zoomin’ Who” and its Grammy-winning single, “Freeway of Love,” and she followed through in the next decades as a kind of soul singer emeritus: an indomitable diva and a duet partner conferring authenticity on collaborators like George Michael and Annie Lennox. Her latter-day producers included stars like Luther Vandross and Lauryn Hill, who had grown up as her fans.

       " '“Sexy if tragic love story” has pretty much been the calling card for “Romeo and Juliet” since the late 16th century. In 1957, “West Side Story” added “hummable” to the tale’s résumé, though not everyone thought so at first. Back then, Leonard Bernstein’s music was considered longhair for Broadway. Now it is so deeply embedded in our ears it’s almost impossible to distinguish it from the rest of the soundtrack of our lives. Even the 2 train sings “Somewhere.”\\n\\nBut Barrington’s lean and conventional production helps us hear it again. (For an unconventional “West Side Story” we’ll have to wait until December 2019, when Ivo van Hove and Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker have a stab at it on Broadway.) That there are fewer Jets, fewer Sharks, and fewer instruments in the orchestra — only 11 instead of the original 28 — makes each one count more, and reveals the bones sometimes hidden in the strings and schmaltz.\\n\\nThose bones are excellent. The book by Arthur Laurents not only updates Shakespeare but also, in terms of plot efficiency, tops him. (“West Side Story” condenses the timeline from four days to 31 hours.) Having done that, Laurents then let Bernstein and Sondheim swallow most of his work to feed their score; the result is one of the shortest (and best) books of a Golden Age musical.\\n\\nThe Barrington version — staged like a punch in the stomach by the company’s artistic director, Julianne Boyd — takes that speed as its cue, delivering the show, uncut, in barely 2 hours and 15 minutes. All of the Jerome Robbins choreography, here recreated by Robert La Fosse, is intact, and creditably performed by dancers impetuous enough to render it believable.\\n\\nIn that context it takes only the slightest underlining to make certain themes stick out. I heard, as I hadn’t quite before, how a police officer calls the Puerto Rican men “trash.” How, after her first night “as a young lady of America,” Maria (Addie Morales) already knows to tell Tony (Will Branner) that he must “come to the back door” when visiting her at the bridal shop where she works. And how even that life force Anita (Skyler Volpe, sensational) is defeated by the grinding force of hatred.\\n\\nA homely banner hanging over the action during the dance at the gym proclaims the virtues of “Justice, Liberty, Good Neighbors.” That touch of directorial comment is enough to shove this production fully into the present. A grander, more polished “West Side Story” might not have entered the summer’s conversation so vigorously — asking, like “Dangerous House” and the distant 2 train, if there’s really “a place for us.”',\n",

In 1977, he revealed that he had successfully used this method to trace the path of bacterial evolution, finding an entirely new domain in the process — a whole branch of the tree of life that others had missed altogether.\\n\\nAt the time, scientists grouped all life into two main categories: the bacteria and the non-bacteria, or eukaryotes. Woese exploded that view. His research showed that there is a third group of organisms, the archaea, which are genetically distinct from other life-forms.\\n\\nPreviously, scientists had lumped the archaea in with the bacteria. Woese proved that archaea and bacteria had sufficiently divergent evolutionary histories to be considered different from one another.\\n\\nWoese’s discovery was controversial at the time, though it is no longer. And his work laid the foundations for a new field of science called molecular phylogeny that has delivered astounding insights about evolutionary history.\\n\\nQuammen details how scientists have now revealed genetic evidence that the branches of the tree of life are not so isolated from one another as Darwin thought. Organisms from different branches can transfer genes to each other — and often do.\\n\\nBacteria, plants and animals can swap genes across species lines, and this activity seems to have shaped evolution in profound ways. Scientists call this swapping “horizontal gene transfer,” to distinguish it from the “vertical gene transfer” that occurs between parents and offspring. Horizontal gene transfer explains why bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics so quickly, for instance: They can transfer antibiotic resistance genes back and forth among species relatively easily.\\n\\nBut horizontal gene transfer also poses a major challenge to the Darwinian concept of evolution, in which species evolve over time into separate lineages. Darwin thought that evolutionary change happened very slowly, as incremental genetic changes were passed down, over hundreds of thousands of generations, from parents to children. And while this slow change does happen, gene-swapping via horizontal gene transfer happens much faster, driving major changes relatively quickly.',\n",

The notion that top-down decisions by politicians, not teachers, should determine what children need was a thread running through the bipartisan 2001 No Child Left Behind Act, the Obama administration’s Race to the Top and state-initiated Common Core standards, and the current charter-driven agenda of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. “Accountability” became synonymous with standardized tests, resulting in a testing juggernaut with large profits going to commercial publishing giants like Pearson.\\n\\nThe education wars have been demoralizing for teachers, over 17 percent of whom drop out within their first five years. No one believes that teaching to the test is good pedagogy, but what are the options when students’ future educational choices, teachers’ salaries and retention and, in some states, the fate of entire schools rest on student test scores?\\n\\nIn meticulous if sometimes too laborious detail, Gabor documents reform’s institutional failings. She describes the sorry turns in New York City’s testing-obsessed policies, the undermining of Michigan’s once fine public schools (spurred in part by constant pressure from the DeVos family) and the heartbreaking failure of New Orleans to remake its schools after Hurricane Katrina. The largely white city establishment bypassed the majority-black community, inviting philanthropists and the federal government to rebuild its public schools as the nation’s first citywide, all-charter system.

       " 'The following decade saw an explosive recognition of the bizarre, counterintuitive phenomenon called horizontal gene transfer and the role it has played throughout the history of life. That explosion occurred during the 1990s but had deep precedents, even before Woese’s work opened the door to appreciating its unimaginable prevalence and significance.\\n\\nThe first recognition by science that any such thing as H.G.T. might be possible dates to 1928, when an English medical researcher named Fred Griffith first detected a puzzling transformation among the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia: one strain changing suddenly into another strain, presto, from harmless to deadly virulent. At the Rockefeller Institute in New York during the 1940s, Oswald Avery and two colleagues identified the “transforming principle” in such instantaneous transmogrifications as naked DNA — that is, genes, moving sideways, from one strain of bacteria into another. To say that seemed odd is an understatement. Genes weren’t supposed to move sideways; they were supposed to move vertically, from parents to offspring — even when the “parents” were bacteria, reproducing by fission. But by 1953, the great Joshua Lederberg, then at the University of Wisconsin, had shown that this sort of transformation, relabeled “infective heredity,” is a routine and important process in bacteria. Still more unexpectedly, as later work would reveal, H.G.T. is not unique to bacteria.\\n\\nSlowly at first, during the 1980s and early 1990s, H.G.T. became a favored research focus in more than a few labs. Many researchers had followed Woese’s lead, using ribosomal rRNA as the basis for comparing one organism with another, judging relatedness and constructing trees of life. But then, as new tools and methods made gene sequencing easier and faster, and as more powerful computers allowed analysis of the vast troves of genomic data, researchers went far beyond 16S rRNA, comparing other genes and whole genomes. What they found surprised them: that many genes had moved sideways from one lineage of life into another. Such genes might be absent from most living species within a group (say, a family of butterfly species), implying that it was absent too from the common ancestral form, but it might show up unexpectedly in one species of butterfly in that family, matching closely to a gene that exists only in another kind of creature (say, a bacterium), classified to an entirely different part of the tree of life. How could that happen? If the gene was absent from the common ancestor, it couldn’t have gotten into the anomalous butterfly species by vertical descent.\\n\\nResearchers have identified three primary mechanisms by which H.G.T. occurs, each of which has a formalized label: conjugation, transformation and transduction. Conjugation is sometimes loosely called “bacterial sex.” It occurs when two individual bacteria (they needn’t be of the same species) form a copulation-like connection, and a segment of DNA passes from one to the other. (It’s isn’t really bacterial sex because it involves gene exchange but not reproduction.) Transformation is what Fred Griffith noticed in 1928: uptake of naked DNA, left floating in the environment after the rupture of some living cell, by another living cell (again, not necessarily of the same species). Transduction is a sort of drag-and-drop trick performed by viruses, picking up bits of DNA from cells they infect, then dropping those DNA bits later within other infected cells, where they may become incorporated into the genomes.\\n\\nConjugation was known to be widespread and common among bacteria. H.G.T. by transformation and transduction could potentially occur among other creatures too, even eukaryotes — even animals and plants — though that prospect was far more uncertain and startling, into the 1990s and beyond. Then improved genome sequencing and closer scrutiny brought more surprises. A bacterium had sent bits of its DNA into the nuclear genomes of infected plants. How was that possible? A species of sea urchin seemed to have shared one of its genes with a very different species of sea urchin, from which its lineage diverged millions of years earlier. That was a stretch. Still another bacterium, the familiar E. coli, transferred DNA into brewer’s yeast, which is a fungus. Brewer’s yeast is microbial, a relatively simple little creature, but nonetheless eukaryotic. This mixing of fungal host and bacterial genes happened via a smooching process that looked much like bacterial transformation, the researchers reported, and “could be evolutionarily significant in promoting trans-kingdom genetic exchange.” Trans-kingdom is a long way for a gene to go.\\n\\nNew investigations, as time passed and improvements in gene-sequencing technology made more complete genomes available, showed that far more radical leaps were happening, and not infrequently. For instance: There’s a peculiar group of tiny animals known as rotifers, once studied only by invertebrate zoologists but now notable throughout molecular biology for their “massive” uploads of alien genes. Rotifers are homely beyond imagining. They live in water, mainly freshwater, and in moist environments such as soils and mosses, rain gutters and sewage-treatment tanks. Some species favor harsh, changeable environments that sometimes go dry, and their individuals reproduce without sex. Despite the absence of sexual recombination, which shuffles the genetic deck in a population and offers new combinations of genes, these rotifers have managed to find newness by other means. One means is horizontal gene transfer. Three researchers at Harvard and Woods Hole sequenced portions of the genome of a certain rotifer and found all sorts of craziness that shouldn’t have been there. More specifically, they found at least 22 genes from other creatures, most of which, they concluded, must have arrived by H.G.T. Some of those were bacterial genes, some were fungal. One gene had come from a plant. At least a few of those genes were still functional, producing enzymes or other products useful to the rotifer.\\n\\nSome of these individual cases were later challenged, but the trend of discoveries held. H.G.T. also started showing up among insects. Again this was supposed to be impossible. There were fervent doubters. Alien genes cannot move from one species to another, they insisted. The germ line of animals, meaning the eggs and the sperm and the reproductive cells that give rise to them, is held separate from such influences. It’s sequestered behind what biologists call the Weismann barrier, named for August Weismann, the German biologist of the 19th and early 20th centuries who defined the concept. Bacteria cannot cross that barricade, the Weismann barrier — so said the skeptical view — to insert bits of their own DNA into animal genomes. Impossible. But again it turned out to be possible.',\n",

When regulators finally threatened to intervene, the companies did what they were best at: They scaled up, this time not with software and servers but with phalanxes of lobbyists and lawyers.\\n\\nMicrosoft had virtually no Washington presence before the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company in the 1990s. As recently as 2003, Google retained just two outside lobbyists in Washington; over the next decade or so, as it became the world’s dominant search engine, the company became a Beltway heavyweight, hiring lobbyists, wooing regulators and funding the research behind hundreds of Google-friendly studies on competition, copyright law and other topics. By last year, Google’s parent, Alphabet, was spending more money on lobbyists than any other corporation in America.\\n\\nFacebook, a decade younger than Google, built its political apparatus twice as fast, as if observing a kind of Moore’s Law of influence-peddling. When it went public in 2012, the company had 900 million users — less than half its current size — and earned a relatively modest profit of $53 million. Over the next several years, Facebook simultaneously became one of the world’s biggest collectors of personal data and a powerful presence in Washington and beyond. It acquired Instagram, a rival social media platform, and the messaging service WhatsApp, bringing Facebook access to billions of photos and other user data, much of it from smartphones; formed partnerships with country’s leading third-party data brokers, such as Acxiom, to ingest huge quantities of commercial data; and began tracking what its users did on other websites. Smart exploitation of all that data allowed Facebook to target advertising better than almost anyone, and by 2015, the company was earning $4 billion a year from mobile advertising. Starting in 2011, Facebook doubled the amount of money it spent on lobbying in Washington, then doubled it again. The company employed just 10 lobbyists in state capitals around the country in 2012, according to my analysis of data collected by the National Institute on Money in Politics. By the time Mactaggart and Arney began work on their privacy initiative, it had 67. The tech industry was particularly powerful in California, its home base, where it doled out millions in campaign contributions to state candidates and parties.\\n\\nBut until recently, companies like Facebook and Google also had something that Wall Street and Big Oil and the cable companies didn’t. To many people in Washington, they were the good guys. Through the Obama years, the tech industry enjoyed extraordinary cachet in Washington, not only among Republicans but also among Democrats. Partnering with Silicon Valley allowed Democrats to position themselves as pro-business and forward-thinking. The tech industry was both an American economic success story and a political ally to Democrats on issues like immigration. Google enjoyed particularly close ties to the Obama administration: Dozens of Google alumni would serve in the White House or elsewhere in the administration, and by one estimate Google representatives visited the White House an average of about once a week. But the Obama world had relationships with other firms too. Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, served on a high-level Obama advisory council on jobs and held a fund-raiser for Obama’s re-election campaign at her home in Atherton, Calif. The founders of Twitter, LinkedIn and the app developer Zynga together contributed more than $2 million to a pro-Obama super PAC.\\n\\nAnd increasingly, Silicon Valley had come to transform politics itself. As Mactaggart considered how to take on the data industry, he faced an American political establishment that saw the key to its future in companies like Google and Facebook — not because of whom they supported but because of what they did. The surveillance capitalists didn’t just sell more deodorant; they had built one of the most powerful tools ever invented for winning elections. Roughly the same suite of technologies helped elect Obama, a pragmatic liberal who promised racial progress and a benevolent globalism, and Trump, a strident nationalist who adeptly employs social media to stoke racial panic and has set out to demolish the American-led world order.\\n\\nIn Washington and in state capitals, this combination of wealth, prestige and ignorance had made the tech industry virtually unbeatable. They doled out campaign money to Republicans and Democrats alike. They had allies across the major think tanks and universities. Facebook alone belonged to more than four dozen trade associations and industry coalitions, political shields that could advance Facebook’s interests in battles that were too toxic for direct engagement. It supported the Anti-Defamation League and the American Council of the Blind, the American Conservative Union and the N.A.A.C.P. It disbursed millions of dollars in grants to tech-advocacy groups — including those that sometimes criticized them. Like the web of personal data it mined for profit, Silicon Valley’s political network was simultaneously immense, powerful and inscrutable.',\n",

So Ross Evangelista, their agent with Stribling, offered an alternative: a roughly 1,800-square-foot duplex “studio” in a prewar co-op in Midtown East. It was the only apartment of its size they could afford below 135th street, but there was a hitch: The space was entirely below street level.\\n\\n“I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this is incredible’ and ‘Oh, my gosh, what a complete wreck,’ ” Mrs. Yanev said of the apartment, where the upper level is partially below grade.\\n\\nThe unit was dark and had been vacant for several years because of a legal dispute with the previous owner that involved allegations of mold. But they saw potential: Walls of glass could be installed to bring in sunlight in the back, where the land slopes down; ceilings could be raised to 14 feet; and two private outdoor spaces, a terrace and a basement patio, offered a glimpse of suburban life.\\n\\nThey bought the apartment for $1.2 million in 2015 and spent more than a year renovating the space, which now includes a downstairs master bedroom, a nursery for their 11-month-old, Oscar, a guest room and a temperature-controlled wine closet.

       " 'Though the study did not analyze fathers’ role in depth, it found that their beliefs did not change significantly before and after having a baby. They were less likely than women to say that parenthood was harder than they expected. (Women still do the bulk of child care, even in two-earner families.)\\n\\nWomen got it so wrong, the researchers argue, because it has become harder to work and have children.\\n\\nThe cost of motherhood fell for most of the 20th century because of inventions like dishwashers, formula and the birth control pill. But that’s no longer the case, according to data cited in the paper. The cost of child care has increased by 65 percent since the early 1980s. Eighty percent of women breast-feed, up from about half. The number of hours that parents spend on child care has risen, especially for college-educated parents, for whom it has doubled.\\n\\nOver all , women have had great success in entering the labor force. Seventy percent of mothers with children under 18 work. Women are more likely to work than previous generations at almost every age, found Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist. They’re slightly more likely to stop in their late 30s and early 40s, around the time many are taking care of young children — but they usually return to the labor force, particularly if they have degrees.\\n\\nStill, the new paper raises questions about why the work-family juggle seems to be getting harder. “It is deeply puzzling that at a moment when women are more prepared than ever for long careers in the labor market, norms would change in a manner that encourages them to spend more time at home,” the researchers wrote.\\n\\nOne possible reason is that increasingly, people who work long, inflexible hours are paid disproportionately more, Ms. Goldin’s research has found. More women with degrees and these kinds of demanding jobs are having children, and they’re likely to be married to men with similar jobs, as Marianne Bertrand, an economist at the University of Chicago, has described. A result is that dual-earning couples may feel the best choice is for one member, usually the mother, to step back from work so the other parent can maximize the family’s earnings.\\n\\nTo try to set their children on the best path amid increased competition for college admission, parents, especially college-educated ones, invest significantly more time than they used to in child care, found Valerie Ramey and Garey Ramey, economists at the University of California, San Diego.

       " 'Drug overdoses killed about 72,000 Americans last year, a record number that reflects a rise of around 10 percent, according to new preliminary estimates from the Centers for Disease Control. The death toll is higher than the peak yearly death totals from H.I.V., car crashes or gun deaths.\\n\\nAnalysts pointed to two major reasons for the increase: A growing number of Americans are using opioids, and drugs are becoming more deadly. It is the second factor that most likely explains the bulk of the increased number of overdoses last year.\\n\\nThe picture is not equally bleak everywhere. In parts of New England, where a more dangerous drug supply arrived early, the number of overdoses has begun to fall. That was the case in Massachusetts, Vermont and Rhode Island; each state has had major public health campaigns and has increased addiction treatment. Preliminary 2018 numbers from Massachusetts suggest that the death rate there may be continuing to fall.\\n\\nBut nationwide, the crisis worsened in the first year of the Trump presidency, a continuation of a long-term trend.

       " 'It’s been six months since a former student opened fire in their high school and killed 17 students and staff members. In the aftermath, these students became instant activists. I spent three days this month with them and the young advocates they’d picked up along the way.\\n\\nI learned, as I wrote in my article, just how much work went into planning the tour: The lead organizer, 17-year-old Jaclyn Corin, will sleep for two hours and then wake up to answer more texts. I learned how much they are emphasizing the broad scope of gun violence, a problem that goes far beyond mass shootings in suburban high schools. I talked to people like Bria Smith of Milwaukee, who used to feel she had “no voice,” and Ramon Contreras of New York, who used to be frustrated by how much attention the Parkland students were getting when activists like him had been working for years. They both talked about how inclusive the movement was, and how that gave them hope.\\n\\nThese points are crucial in explaining how this movement is different from all the ones that didn’t work. But there were other things I was determined to capture, too. I wanted to capture the students’ youth, and their humanity. (“A lot of our innocence was taken away from us, but our youth wasn’t,” Lauren Hogg, David’s younger sister, mused in one group discussion. “I think that’s a really powerful thing.”) And I wanted to capture what it was like behind the scenes of this movement — the messy, stressful work that goes into creating something that appears so polished.\\n\\nTo do that, I had to talk to the students. But more important, I had to see them.\\n\\nSo I introduced myself — and then, for much of the first two days, I stood back and watched. As a tour guide led us through the galleries of the International Civil Rights Center and Museum in Greensboro, the students’ media handler came over to me and whispered that he could pull aside anyone I wanted to interview. I said no thanks. I had three days to interview the students. I didn’t want to interrupt an event to do it.\\n\\nI still got the interviews I needed before I went home. But in the meantime, I was able to take in the museum’s exhibits just as the students were. I was able to note their body language and their expressions.

Ms. Froelich was looking through visual research material that had been gathered for a coming cover story by the reporter Susan Ferraro on breast cancer awareness activism, which asked: “How many angry women does it take to start a revolution?”\\n\\nMatuschka’s self-portraits “stopped you in your tracks,” Ms. Froelich said this month. “No one had seen this scar before, unless you had it, or a close family member had it.

       " 'Niemeyer’s legacy rests largely in his creation of the city of Brasília in the late 1950s, which he conceived with Costa, at the behest of Brazil’s president at the time, Juscelino Kubitschek, who had campaigned with the slogan “Fifty years’ progress in five.” Kubitschek was an ambitious leader who believed Brazil could industrialize at lightning speed, shed its colonial past and compete in the global economy. Located hundreds of miles inland, Brasília was erected in just three and a half years at an exorbitant cost (estimates put it at the tens of billions in today’s dollars), replacing Rio as the country’s capital in 1960. Niemeyer, who found inspiration in Le Corbusier’s unrealized Radiant City, a utopian concept where life was ordered by design, wrote: “The seat of government must be established in the heart of Brazil’s vast territory, so that it surveys the whole national panorama, so that it will be within reach of all the classes and all the regions.” But once made, the large plazas meant to stimulate civic life remained empty. The thousands of workers who had traveled from the less industrialized parts of the country were left stranded in the low-income housing, or favelas, that had been hastily erected during construction. In 1964, a military coup supported by the United States government changed the course of the nation forever. Politically to the left of the new military regime, Niemeyer moved to Paris in 1967. His career suffered. Over the decades, architectural Modernism became less popular, perceived as too dogmatic — but Niemeyer continued to work, finding newfound appreciation in the years before his death at the age of 104 in 2012. Some of his most stunning works are in Brasília, including the Supreme Court (1958-60), whose columns of concrete clad in white marble echo the fluttering of a sheet in the wind.

       " 'That’s surprising, given that amezaiku speaks to the Japanese obsession with all things kawaii, or “cute,” which arguably developed as a response to the failed antiwar student protests of the 1960s. In the economic boom that followed, kawaii, defined as something both lovable and pitiable — which is to say, something lovable because it is naïve to forces larger than itself — provided both solace and consumerist distraction from dashed hopes for change. But it is also a protest against the rigidity of Japanese society, a choice to remain innocent instead of joining the ranks of miserable adults. In this, amezaiku suggests a connection between kawaii’s sentimental appeal and the Japanese principle of mono no aware, loosely translated as “the sadness of things,” or an attunement to the power of objects to awaken our empathy.\\n\\nStill, unlike wagashi — the classical tea-ceremony treats with complex flavors and textures, haiku-like names and brief shelf lives — these lollipops are not intended to be allegories of impermanence. They don’t contain mysteries; their entire story is told through their making, and most of their pleasure derives from witnessing true virtuosity, another Japanese specialty: the steady hands, the coaxing of form out of formlessness, the race against time. Risking pain makes the achievement all the greater, as with Japan’s urushi, lacquerware that requires artisans to work with toxic sap. Through repeated contact, they grow immune.\\n\\nThough amezaiku is dying out as street craft, its spectacle has been embraced on social media, earning it recognition beyond Japan. The greatest appraisal has gone to the 29-year-old Shinri Tezuka, who runs two shops in Tokyo, and who renounces cuteness for realism. His intricately detailed creatures, often pulled from the deep sea, wed beauty with menace: giant squid, arms flowing like streamers; venom-spined scorpionfish, mouth agape to capture prey.

You’re allowed to put more than one letter or word in a square? Yes. Yes, you are. But only when the puzzle calls for it. You can’t just do it randomly. Aren’t we supposed to be warned when a rebus exists in the puzzle? No, that’s part of the fun of solving. If more than one rebus exists in a square — and why do you do this to us? — is there a way to predict the order in which the rebus elements are supposed to be entered? Yes, there is. The Across entry is entered first, and then the Down entry. We give examples below. How am I supposed to put more than one letter or word in a square if I am solving online or on my device? Keep reading. We explain that in the last section.\\n\\nWhat is a Rebus?\\n\\nA rebus can be a letter, number or symbol that represents a word, but in many crosswords, the rebus will be a word or group of letters that need to be written inside a single square.\\n\\nYou’ll find two kinds of letter-based rebus elements in a crossword.\\n\\nThe first is where the rebus entry reads the same for both the intersecting Across and Down entries, like this puzzle by Elizabeth Long from December 1, 2011, where the word JACK was the rebus element.',\n",

The umami taste is said to trigger the sustained secretion of a more viscous form of saliva than other tastes.\\n\\nIn scientific terms, the taste of umami is thought to be derived from substances combining the amino acid glutamate and the nucleotides inosinate and guanylate, with minerals such as sodium and potassium.\\n\\nIn more lay terms, umami serves as a signal to the body that we have consumed protein. Sensing umami triggers the secretion of saliva and digestive juices, facilitating the smooth digestion of protein.',\n",

My boat expertise is scant. There are also such things as SKIPJACKS — turns out to be the Maryland state boat, developed in the late 19th century to dredge for oysters. The skipjacks of the fish world are usually tuna or herring. The term refers to a type of grace or buoyancy, demonstrated by skipping across the water’s surface.\\n\\n22A: It’s good that Mr. Diehl specified this character's appearance in “Muppets Tonight”; this is a ’90s reboot of my beloved original “Muppet Show” of the 1970s, which did not include PEPE the King Prawn. This character is a little bit of a queasy stereotype, surprising for the Muppets. But even weirder is that he became the spokesMuppet for a seafood fast-food chain, Long John Silver’s, in the early aughts.

Those are KNURLs.\\n\\n33A: SAGITTA (“Constellation between Cygnus and Aquila”) has appeared in The New York Times only twice before. It was clued with reference to being the Arrow constellation in those other puzzles, just in case you are not up on your constellation orders.\\n\\n5D: I’ll be honest here: College high jinks gave me this answer. Please don’t tell my parents. When I was in school, there was an off-campus bar called SUTTER’s Mill, and the story of the California gold rush was painted inside on a mural. Or perhaps those were the waiters, who can remember? At any rate, someone found flakes of gold near John SUTTER’s sawmill and that started the gold rush.\\n\\n11D: I will tell you what: I have seen some iguanas in my time, and they’re adorable, but if I ever encountered a 30-foot one, I’m pretty sure I would run screaming in the other direction. Unless it let me go for a ride on its back, on two legs or four, it doesn’t matter to me.\\n\\n33D: Great misdirection. “Big cheese wheels?” puts me in mind of large rounds of Camembert, but today we are thinking about the kind of wheels in which a big cheese, or important person, might be driven around. That would be a STATE CAR.\\n\\n48D: Oh, so many ways to use the word “Spinner?” It could refer to a top, it could refer to someone who spins a yarn (both literally and as a teller of tales) and it could also refer to someone who puts a “spin” on things, like a P.R.

For example, the clue for 24A is “FIRED.” By the time I read this clue, I already had a few of the letters at the end of the entry, and it occurred to me that “FIRED” could be an apt anagram for FRIED. (That was a guess on my part, but then again, I’m trained to think that way.) So I dropped in FRIED at the end of the entry and briefly wondered what the first part could be before I went on my merry way to solve more of the puzzle. It took a while, but I eventually got the entire answer, which is STIR FRIED, and my response to that realization was basically “Huh.”\\n\\nI completed a lot more of the puzzle before that “Huh” turned into an “Aha!” Ms. Wienberg has taken familiar two-word phrases that contain, in either the first word or the second, an anagram of the clue.\\n\\nAnd here is where the similarity to solving a cryptic crossword clue emerges: In a cryptic crossword, an anagram indicator is typically a word that describes mixing things up. We have been told in the theme entry that the clue is an anagram, because the instruction to move the letters around is right there.

If the objective of solving is to neatly tie together the clues and answers in a starkly ruled box, then starting neatly at the beginning makes sense. Most of the time, however, skipping around will become necessary, because no one knows everything and we’ve been trained from years of test-taking in school to skip what we don’t know and come back to it when there is time.\\n\\nThat’s a decent puzzle-solving strategy, although if you do it today, you might miss lunch.

       " 'And “Part of Adam from which Eve was fashioned” for RIB? Whether you read the Bible literally or not, such a clue plays on the old trope that women were meant to be secondary to men because they were made from part of them. There are many other ways to clue RIB, as well as VAMP, which is clued once again as a “Femme fatale.” A VAMP can also be the front part of a shoe or boot, or a short musical passage. Would those be Monday-level clues? Hard to tell, but they would avoid the disappointment women face when they solve a puzzle and see themselves portrayed the way this one appears to see them.\\n\\nToday’s Theme\\n\\nMs. Lempel offers us a set of phrases that can be clued both positively and somewhat negatively. For example, at 17A, the clue for GO DOWN IN HISTORY is “Leave a lasting legacy … or do worse at school.” Similarly, at 39A, you can “Score in baseball … or ruin some hose,” and the answer to that one is GET A RUN.\\n\\nThe revealer at 61A, GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS, isn’t exactly how I would begin a “mixed message,” as the clue indicates — I would say “I’ve got some GOOD NEWS and some BAD NEWS” — but I get where it’s going. On the whole, though, I enjoyed the humor in the theme.\\n\\nConstructor Notes\\n\\nThis had to be the fastest acceptance of all time. I snail-mailed the puzzle on a Friday and got an email back on Monday! I couldn’t believe it had even gotten there already. Will said he wanted to use it for a Monday, but I’d written Tuesday-ish clues. So he asked me to suggest easier clues for some of the answers. He also said he was concerned that my clue for MAKE PASSES was awfully harsh, and he asked me to soften it. So the clue was changed to what you see today, from my original “ … invite a sexual harassment charge.”\\n\\nAs is very often the case, this idea simmered for many moons before I could come up with a final themer to balance DRAW A BLANK. I wasn’t really thrilled with MAKE PASSES, but at some point you have to just throw in the towel and go with something.\\n\\nWill did ease up slightly more than I did on the clues, but over all, they’re not far different from my revised version.

       " '华盛顿——美国和中国将在本月底重返谈判桌，争取缓解自今年贸易谈判破裂以来持续数月的紧张关系，两国已经对彼此加征了几个轮次的关税。\\n\\n此番会谈正值双方贸易关系面临进一步恶化之际。特朗普政府准备了覆盖面更大的关税措施，包括对另外一批价值160亿美元的中国商品征收关税，预计该措施将于下周四生效。美国贸易代表发言人说，特朗普政府还计划在未来两周举行为期六天的听证会，将有多达370名证人现身，对另外价值2000亿美元的中国商品关税计划发表意见。\\n\\n如果这些关税全部生效，美国每年将对从中国进口的一半商品征税，这会导致大量的制造商、零售商和其他行业提高价格。\\n\\n这次中层官员之间的会晤不同于特朗普政府初期美中高级经济团队之间的正式会谈，以及由财政部长史蒂芬·马努钦(Steven Mnuchin)和负责经济政策的中国副总理在今年春天举行的贸易会谈。\\n\\n周四，白宫国家经济委员会(National Economic Council)主任拉里·库德洛(Larry Kudlow)试图降低人们的期望值，坚称特朗普总统无意放弃自己的要求。\\n\\n库德洛在接受CNBC采访时说：“无论何时，谈总比不谈好。”\\n\\n库德洛说，美方的要求没有变，中国必须降低关税和非关税壁垒，停止窃取美国的知识产权。\\n\\n他还说：“从整体上，中国政府可不要低估特朗普总统的强硬和继续这场战斗的意愿。”\\n\\n除了关税问题，汇率问题已重新引起特朗普政府的关注，预计它们都是本轮谈判的内容。\\n\\n自4月初以来，人民币兑美元的汇率已下跌约10％，对外国人来说，这一变化令中国制造的商品变得更便宜了，从而有助于抵消特朗普政府增收关税所带来的影响。\\n\\n经济学家说，由于市场力量、美元走强以及中国政府的影响，人民币已经走弱。中国政府为人民币设定了一个基准线，允许它在一个狭窄的范围内波动。\\n\\n这一下降将预先给财政部10月份的报告施加压力，在该报告中，马努钦将决定是否把某些国家标记为货币操纵者。到目前为止，特朗普政府并未给中国贴上这个标签，并表示虽然中国过去操纵过汇率，但这个问题目前已经不存在了。\\n\\n但在上个月，中国货币再次成为特朗普的目标。\\n\\n一位知情人士表示，在即将举行的会谈中，美国财政部将向中国施加压力，要求它提升人民币价值。但未来几个月实施的其他美国关税措施可能会进一步压低人民币兑美元的汇率，加剧了这些行动的困难。\\n\\n特朗普政府正在多个阵线卷入贸易冲突，目前，美国谈判代表正寻求与加拿大和墨西哥就北美自由贸易协定(North American Free Trade Agreement)进行谈判，并在未来几个月与欧洲和日本同行举行更多会谈。\\n\\n与此同时，与中国的谈判进展缓慢。白宫对中国提出的额外购买数百亿美元美国产品的提议似乎并不感兴趣，特朗普政府官员表示，这些产品不能满足的要求，即中国对其部分由国家所有的经济进行充分的改革。\\n\\n在达成协议方面，马尔帕斯甚至比马努钦更没有权力，虽然财政部一直是最积极推动贸易停战的机构，但即将征收关税的中国商品清单编制工作，是由罗伯特·E·莱特希泽(Robert E. Lighthizer)领导的美国贸易代表办公室(Office of the United States Trade Representative)正式负责的。\\n\\n马努钦说，上个月在阿根廷举行的20国集团财长会议上，他只和中国同行做了“闲谈”，并且取得突破的关键在于中国。\\n\\n“这对两国政府来说似乎是浪费时间，”国际战略研究中心(Center for Strategic and International Studies)中国商业与政治经济项目主任甘思德(Scott Kennedy)在推特上说。“谁会认为美国财政部有权达成那项能够结束贸易战的交易？”',\n",

       " '香港——据当地媒体报道，多年来，中国的鱼贩们一直在把其他的鱼类标为“三文鱼”出售。这篇报道激怒了全国各地的寿司爱好者。\\n\\n现在，中国渔业部门做出了回应：鱼贩的做法完全没有问题。\\n\\n中国监管机构本周表示，按照一家政府下属的渔业协会和13家商业渔场制定的新标准，虹鳟可以作为三文鱼出售。官方援用了生物学来证明改变定义的合理性：鲑鱼和虹鳟在市场上统称三文鱼。他们也要求鱼贩在标签的其他地方注明鱼的确切品种。\\n\\n尽管如此，这个模糊的定义还是在一个长期存在着食品标签问题、有着大量日益成熟的消费者的国家触动了人们的神经。数千人在互联网上抨击监管机构降低食品标准，而不是解决问题。一些人宣布他们再也不吃三文鱼了。\\n\\n就连一家寿司店的顾客们也说，他们不再生吃三文鱼，因为不能确信其是真的。\\n\\n“如果我碰到特别便宜的三文鱼，又很难分辨是不是虹鳟的话，我大概不会点，”20岁的大学生马欣怡（音）说。自从三个月前有关鲑鱼与鳟鱼混为一谈的报道传开后，她开始只吃熟的三文鱼。\\n\\n“这不仅是用虹鳟替代鲑鱼的问题，也是淡水鱼是否应该被用来做刺身的问题，”香港理工大学应用生物及化学科技学系助理教授凯文·郭(Kevin Kwok)博士说。\\n\\n其他地方的监管机构对用一种鱼代替另一种鱼持不赞成态度。\\n\\n鲑鱼也不例外。美国官员禁止卖鱼者给钢头鳟（steelhead trout，本质上是一种生活在海水中的虹鳟）贴上鲑鱼的标签。一般来说，鲑鱼在淡水中产卵，但返回大海生活。\\n\\n有关三文鱼的新规定在中国出台的三个月前，官方媒体曾播放过一段介绍青海省龙阳峡水库一个大型淡水养殖场的视频。视频说，该养殖场提供了中国市场上三分之一的三文鱼。这引起了中国其他媒体的兴趣，因为青海是一个远离海洋的内陆省份。随后的报道称，中国市场上相当数量的被标为三文鱼的鱼，实际上是虹鳟。\\n\\n渔业人士辩称，鲑鱼和虹鳟在本质上是一样的，中国的监管机构本周对此表示认同。中国农业部下属的行业组织中国水产流通与加工协会本周发布的规定说，尽管虹鳟可以作为三文鱼出售，但商场和餐馆也必须标出所售鱼的种类和产地。例如，标签上可能这样写：“三文鱼（大西洋鲑）”、或“三文鱼（虹鳟）”。\\n\\n成本较高的虹鳟通常在玻璃纤维缸或海水网箱中养殖。一些养殖者在水中添加盐，尽管养殖专家凯文·郭说盐对寄生虫的影响还没有被广泛研究过。他说，大西洋鲑也携带寄生虫，但这些寄生虫不太可能感染人类。\\n\\n中国的渔业部门为淡水养殖的安全性做辩护，称中国养鱼场用的水有严格的控制。\\n\\n该协会说，实际上，消费者可能更喜欢虹鳟，而不是鲑。协会称，在挪威和智利等国，“不少当地人更倾向于虹鳟，且虹鳟的价格要高于大西洋鲑。”\\n\\n中国网民嘲笑这种抬高虹鳟身价的说法，他们说宁可只吃普通的鲑鱼，因为他们承担不起携带寄生虫的代价。',\n",
       " '上海——它的聊天应用激发了硅谷的灵感。它拥有世界上最大的一些视频游戏的特许经营权。经过多年发展，它已成为全球最大的互联网公司之一。\\n\\n然而在周三，腾讯遭遇了挫折，没有达到盈利目标，十多年来首次出现利润增长放缓。\\n\\n这一挫败背后的原因同样令人惊讶：中国政府。\\n\\n腾讯总裁刘炽平在财报电话会议中解释说，中国政府高层的官僚改组使公司难以获得通过新游戏赚钱所需的许可。在一起不相关的案例中，中国监管机构认为内容太过血腥而下架了它的另一款游戏——《怪物猎人：世界》(Monster Hunter: World)。\\n\\n“很多游戏还没有得到许可，”刘炽平说，并表示政府已经意识到“重组正在影响整个行业”。\\n\\n这番话罕见地承认了中国政府可以对其最重要的民营企业发挥巨大作用，决定它们的财富和不幸。\\n\\n过度的官僚主义、严厉的审查制度以及对日常管理的过度干涉，这些都是北京的支持可能给公司带来的负面影响。但是中国那些最大的公司别无选择。阿里巴巴的创始人马云说过一句名言，警告高管们要取得平衡。他建议，要爱政府，但不要嫁给他们。\\n\\n腾讯拥有信息和支付应用微信，作为中国不断增长的创新能力的象征，它依然是北京政策的受益者。政府的互联网屏蔽把Facebook等可能的竞争对手排除在外。未来还会有其他有利于该公司的计划，包括政府的一项动议，将微信转变为一种国家的数字身份识别形式。\\n\\n但中国一直是一把双刃剑。\\n\\n周三，腾讯的财报结果令一些美国科技公司的股票下跌，其中许多公司将中国视为潜在的重要增长市场。纳斯达克综合指数下跌约1.2%。\\n\\n“有一个通行的假设，特别是在科技界和科技硬件界流行，那就是中国等于增长，”一手资本管理公司(Firsthand Capital Management)首席投资官凯文·兰迪斯(Kevin Landis)说。“因此，当一个位居前列的公司，一个你靠着它来把握脉搏的公司，现在有了问题，会让你有一点不安。”\\n\\n上个季度腾讯盈利之所以受阻，是因为它无法靠《绝地求生》(PlayerUnknown’s Battleground)在中国赚钱，《绝地求生》是一款大受欢迎的游戏，让玩家在一个遍布武器、车辆和狙击点的岛屿上拼死搏斗。腾讯表示，它正在与监管机构密切合作以获得许可，这样它就可以通过在游戏内销售虚拟物品等方式来赚钱。\\n\\n刘炽平说，腾讯公司正在努力通过审批。他还表示，它是否能够获得通过最终只是时间问题，是否能够获得通过本身并不是问题。有些人反对《绝地求生》的暴力，忠诚玩家经常用智能手机来玩它，在火车和公园等公共场所把手机音量开得很大。游戏《怪物猎人：世界》完全是因为其内容而下架，尽管刘炽平表示公司正在努力“调整内容”以便通过审批。\\n\\n对于腾讯在游戏方面的收入，“监管机构的阻碍肯定造成了损失，”大和资本市场(Daiwa Capital Markets)的分析师约翰·崔(John Choi)表示，并指出腾讯未能将《绝地求生》这样的关键游戏转化为收益。\\n\\n微信也面临几家小公司的新竞争，它们开发了允许用户分享短视频的手机应用。\\n\\n几个月来，对竞争和监管加剧的担忧已经影响了该公司的股价。其股价已从1月的峰值下跌近30%。\\n\\n该公司第二季度净利润为27亿美元，较上年同期下降了2%。这段时期内，公司收入增长了30%，达到111亿美元。',\n",
       " '对任何政府来说，通货膨胀危机都是坏消息，就像土耳其即将发生的那种；但对于某种类型的威权主义者，也就是民粹主义强人来说，这种危机尤其危险。\\n\\n他们特别容易造成这种往往难以修复，而且恢复速度异常缓慢的危机。总体来说，他们国家的通货膨胀率会更高，货币被人为低估的程度更严重。他们的央行不是那么独立，减弱了它们的干预能力。\\n\\n这些表现本身就有可能是灾难性的，它们是一系列直抵民粹强人统治核心的弱点和不利，远不仅限于货币政策。\\n\\n在土耳其之前，有委内瑞拉的尼古拉斯·马杜罗(Nicolas Maduro)及其前任乌戈·查韦斯(Hugo Chavez)，该国在他们的执掌下从繁荣走向毁灭，部分原因正是因为国家陷入通胀危机。\\n\\n当这种情况发生在民主国家时，民选领导人通常会被新领导人所取代，他们将最终控制通货膨胀。仅在拉丁美洲，这样的事情就发生过多次：尼加拉瓜、智利、秘鲁和阿根廷。由政党、军队或君主管理的其他各种威权主义，则有可能崩溃，就像在巴西发生的那样，但他们往往有推行某种改革的意愿和适应力。\\n\\n因为与其公民、权贵阶层和自己的决策机构的关系缘故，民粹强人往往是不同的。马杜罗印了更多钞票，导致危机加剧。十年前，津巴布韦的罗伯特·穆加贝(Robert G. Mugabe)也做了几乎一样的事情，效果差不多。\\n\\n不管土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安(Recep Tayyip Erdogan)最终是否也会走上同样的道路，他眼下已经在重复着人们所熟悉的统治模式，受到一个对国家长远利益不见得有帮助的体制的桎梏和导引。\\n\\n土耳其的崩溃不仅仅是埃尔多安集权的产物，还集中体现了他和其他一些民粹强人的执政风格中所固有的沉疴。它也提醒着人们，虽然他们的体制似乎正在世界崛起，但也带来了特殊的风险，通常，这令其更易崩溃。\\n\\n通胀的威胁\\n\\n每个独裁者都知道，通货膨胀可能会带来生存危机，它会侵蚀其面对公众的执政合法性，激怒期待得到回报的权贵阶层。经选举产生的领导人只是下台而已（大多数时候），但专制国家却更有可能出现彻底崩溃。\\n\\n1989年，被通胀激怒的中国工人加入了理想主义学生的抗议行列，政府的回应行动，则是现代最为血腥的一次镇压。\\n\\n对于威权主义者来说，通胀可能非常危险，甚至可能带来之前难以想象的改革。\\n\\n在上世纪80年代，越南领导人担心通货膨胀可能会导致共产主义制度的垮台，于是转向了更加市场化的经济。\\n\\n2013年，伊朗通胀飙升引发了公众的强烈不满，以至于在选民选择了一个相对温和的总统时，立场强硬的最高精神领袖也未加干预。\\n\\n所有形式的威权主义都容易受到影响：一党制国家（比如中国或古巴）、君主制国家（比如沙特阿拉伯）或军事独裁（比如今天的泰国，以及近代的其他例子）。\\n\\n但作为富有魅力的领袖，强人巩固自己的权力并粉碎可能挑战自己的拦路虎，这会导致这类危机更有可能滋生，也更难以控制。\\n\\n当增长变得危险\\n\\n这种情况很大程度上与强人得到权力的典型方式有关：在一个有缺陷的民主国家内部崛起，或者在某些情况下，在一个军政府或一党制政体中崛起。这令他们需要拆除被他们视为威胁的旧系统。麻烦通常就是从这里开始的。\\n\\n“对自身未来的不安全感会刺激他们做出从长远来看很糟糕的选择，”任教于密歇根州立大学的专制主义研究学者埃里卡·弗兰兹(Erica Frantz)说。\\n\\n随着他们削减制度和竞争对手，破坏自身的合法性，他们更加渴望经济增长，并且看到它出现下滑会感到更加恐慌。\\n\\n这通常会引发危险的超支或过度借贷，埃尔多安的情况就是后者。他的政府鼓励公司疯狂投资外币贷款，推动惊人的经济增长，这让埃尔多安在限制政治权利的同时可以保住支持率。但债务导致了现在爆发的货币危机。\\n\\n中国已经看到了它在基础设施项目和过度投资方面的风险。但是，那些由根深蒂固的贵族、军队或政党官僚机构管理的独裁国家，有一种强人统治者常常觉得需要摧毁的东西：制度。\\n\\n威权制度尽管不公平或公正，但至少是可预测的，并且可以在一定限度内保持独立。这使得它们能够更好地管理或预防问题。特别是中央银行。\\n\\n研究发现，如果独裁政权的央行被视为可信和独立的，通胀就更容易受到限制。但如果央行被视为容易受到任意或不稳定的政治干预——强人统治体系中的制度经常发生这种情况——那么通货膨胀可能会失控。\\n\\n像查韦斯或埃尔多安这样的强人统治者（后者安排他的女婿担任财政部长）倾向于干涉央行，既是为了实现繁荣的短期增长，也是出于将独立机构视为威胁而不是合作伙伴的倾向。通货膨胀的上升是恶化的前兆。\\n\\n强人统治者 是如何制造危机的\\n\\n这些领导者还以其他方式破坏经济。根据2008年的一项研究，当一个国家的法律体系受到侵蚀时，容易出现通货膨胀的急升。\\n\\n即使法治只在少数几个部门被削弱，这最终会波及央行的管理者，他们的行为将不再像是独立的管理者，而是忠诚或恐惧的亲信。\\n\\n像中国这样的官僚独裁经常试图加强法律体系，以巩固自己的统治，即使这些法律制度仍然存在严重缺陷。但像埃尔多安这样清洗其国家法官的领导人，倾向于将司法机构视为威胁。\\n\\n在强人统治之下，经济管理的能力往往不足，因此更有可能助长泡沫或债务，而不是增长。较低级别的官员知道他们的首要任务是取悦和赞美领导者，因此更容易做出过度的承诺或掩盖问题。对他们来说，忠诚胜过了能力。\\n\\n结果往往是强人统治者不仅过度支出或过度借贷——而且这样做的过程还是盲目而忙乱的，并且没有来自央行或其他机构的任何理性。他们会一头冲进其他国家至少会试图避免的危机。\\n\\n高风险的政治体系\\n\\n强人统治者与权贵阶层的关系可能会让事情变得更糟。例如，随着经济下滑，马杜罗越来越害怕发生政变，因此他从军事领导人以及他可以指望的少数权势人物手中抽走了资源。\\n\\n致力于打击竞争对手的强人统治者往往只得到一部分权贵的支持，所以需要讨好他们。这可能会扭曲经济，因为这些成员所在的行业往往在他们刚崛起时是有利可图的，但渐渐已经过时。埃尔多安对大兴土木的热情可能很说明问题，过度借贷大部分就是这样来的。\\n\\n多年来，分析人士认为这种模式可能会毁灭中国。在中国，最有权力的人物控制着庞大的钢铁和建筑帝国，它们所受益的政策与该国经济转型所需的消费产业是矛盾的。许多人认为旧工业势力会阻挠中国的经济转型。\\n\\n然而钢铁大亨们最终被迫就范——一个庞大的专制官僚体制，比一个需要担心自己内部圈子的孤独强人统治者更容易做到这一点。即使是沙特阿拉伯——一个拥有自己的集体企业和机构的君主政权——虽然深受困扰，也依然能够艰难地实行一些不利于旧权贵的变革。',\n",
       " \"中国周日公布了国家主席习近平为无限期延长他作为领导人统治中国而采取的行动。这在中国国内引起了对强人政治再现的新担忧，在国外则引起了对进入一个以敌意和僵局为特征的新时代的忧虑。\\n\\n自2013年担任国家主席以来，习近平一直试图塑造一个致力于推动中国和平崛起的慈父形象。\\n\\n在北京，对习近平持批评意见的政治分析人士吴强（音）说，修改宪法会让习近平变成“超级主席”。\\n\\n“他的权力将不受限制，”他说。\\n\\n政府审查机构急忙屏蔽这一决定受到的批评。网络米姆把习近平描述成一个不尊重法治的皇帝，并显示习近平的画像取代毛泽东的神圣画像，出现在天安门广场上。另一个米姆改编杜蕾斯(Durex)安全套的广告，添加了一句广告词——“干两次，是不够的”——来嘲弄习近平争取第三届任期的主意。\\n\\n共产党作出这一举动之际，正值习近平宣布中国进入一个伟大时代。他说，在这个时代，中国将取得他认为应有的全球大国地位。当下，中国已经开始在西太平洋和非洲建立军事基地，在亚洲各地以及欧洲和非洲部分地区修建基础设施。习近平还希望中国经济在20年或更短的时间内成为世界头号经济体。\\n\\n“中国感觉正走在通往大国地位的道路上，他们想让这种轨迹永远持续下去，”位于弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿的研究机构美国海军分析中心(Center for Naval Analyses，简称CNA)的中国研究主任冯德威(David Finkelstein)说。\\n\\n去年，特朗普与习近平在北京的一个会议上会见了商界领袖后走下台。 Doug Mills/The New York Times\\n\\n中国境外的一些分析人士表示，他们担心允许习近平进行独裁统治可能会导致日趋紧张的美中关系进一步恶化。\\n\\n美国多年努力让中国参与从市场改革到气候变化，再到人权的问题，然而去年12月，特朗普政府令北京受到了刺激，并在其首份国家安全文件中称中国是美国的战略竞争对手。\\n\\n华盛顿的政策制定者正在准备一些计划，涉及对部分中国进口货物征收关税，限制中国在美国的投资（尤其是科技领域），以及增加美国的军费开支，以保持其相对于中国人民解放军的巨大优势。\\n\\n本月早些时候在国会作证时，联邦调查局(FBI)局长克里斯托弗·雷(Christopher Wray)称中国“不仅是十足的政府威胁，还是十足的社会威胁”。\\n\\n《中国幻想》(The China Fantasy)的作者詹姆斯·曼(James Mann)说，特朗普很可能认为习近平巩固权力的举动，属于一种全球趋势，即国家领导人的权力愈来愈大，他也许还会把自己、习近平和俄罗斯领导人弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)归入这个趋势中。《中国幻想》一书还反驳了一个流行的观点，即日渐繁荣会带来中国的政治自由化。\\n\\n“我猜他不会谴责中国缺乏民主，因为这种事他即便做也是偶尔为之，”曼在提到特朗普时说。\\n\\n曼还表示，特朗普对习近平已经实现的目标可能也不会有太多的异议。\\n\\n“上台后的14个月里，特朗普几乎从来没有表示过对我们宪法制度的支持，而在过去的总统声明里，这种支持是基本内容，”曼说。“他不尊重政敌的尊严和人格。他不对法院的独立或言论自由表示支持。”\\n\\n如果真有什么反应的话，他说，“我想特朗普可能会感到嫉妒。”\\n\\n从克林顿到布什再到奥巴马，美国政界流行的观点是，与中国接触会让中国变得更像西方。\\n\\n但正如曼所预言的，中国走向了相反的方向。\\n\\n位于北京的中国人民大学国际关系教授时殷弘说，习近平可能并不在乎世界会如何解读他被任命为潜在的永久统治者。\\n\\n如果赢得第二届任期，特朗普将在2024年离开白宫；如果任期不受限制，习近平的任期几乎肯定会持续到那之后。\\n\\n“这在客观上会让他比特朗普更强大，特朗普没有理由喜欢这个变化，”时殷弘说。\\n\\n在国内，习近平的第三届任期可能会得到相当大的支持。这是一场持续数年的肃清政敌和限制异见人士运动的结果。民族主义者也为这一决定欢呼，称习近平是一种能够让中国重现辉煌的非凡力量。\\n\\n但随着这一消息的传播，中国法律界人士在社交媒体上讨论起了汉娜·阿伦特(Hannah Arendt)关于极权主义统治危害的文章；以及乔治·华盛顿(George Washington)在两届总统任期结束后辞职的经历。\\n\\n卡内基国际和平研究院(Carnegie Endowment for International Peace)的中国专家包道格(Douglas H. Paal)说，在习近平下月开始第二届任期前，突如其来的这一举动表明共产党内部情况并不“正常”。\\n\\n“这看起来像急行军，而不是常态，所以说有事情发生，”包道格说。“习近平赢了，但需要侦查才能发现究竟是什么。这不是平常时期。”\\n\\n包道格说，过去一个月里，一系列中国高官到访华盛顿，试图说服特朗普政府放缓实施可能会引发贸易战的惩罚措施计划，但均以失败告终。\\n\\n“当美国有争议的行动遭遇中国的非常时期时，情况可能会变得复杂，”他说。\\n\\n“因为大批人民对世界大部分地区的无能混乱感到惊讶，又陶醉在民族主义之中，习近平实行这一改变将被视作合理，”伦敦国王学院(King's College London) 中国政治研究教授凯利·布朗(Kerry Brown)说道。\\n\\n但澳大利亚战略政策研究所(Australian Strategic Policy Institute)的执行主任、澳大利亚前国防部高官彼得·詹宁斯(Peter Jennings)表示，习近平关于无限权力的想法可能不会像他设想的那样实现。\\n\\n“他的个人命运有了很大风险，”他说。“要是中国人民解放军决定脱离他怎么办？”他还补充说，“如果增长放缓超过预期呢？”\\n\\n詹宁斯说，如果习近平在国内外受压，他可能会变得难以预测，甚至变得危险。对更大的个人权力的追求可能是他垮台的开始。\\n\\n“这不会给西方国家带来任何安慰，因为习近平的处境意味着他可能会在南海或台湾问题上冒更大风险，”他说。“如果实施接近普京式的边缘政策，那么他没有什么可以失去的，反而可以有所收获。”\\n\\n此外，他补充说，“谁见过得到善终的‘终身元首’呢？”\",\n",

       " '布拉格——当习近平成为第一位访问捷克共和国的中国最高领导人时，随行的还有一位神秘的中国大亨，他有着巨大的政治野心，充足的资金，同捷克总统有着紧密联系。\\n\\n两年前，当中国和捷克政府官员聚集在捷克总统的夏日官邸之外，习近平和捷克总统米洛什·泽曼(Milos Zeman)一起种下银杏树时，叶简明是这群人之中唯一的商人，对于他来说，这相当于认可了他在布拉格的重要权力掮客角色——他在这座城市买下了地标性房产、一座当地啤酒厂和一支备受喜爱的足球队。\\n\\n该会议以及叶简明的出席巩固了中国对泽曼治下的捷克共和国在政治和商业方面的新影响，并标志着中国在欧洲的更大野心。\\n\\n在短短两年内，叶简明的公司中国华信已花费超过10亿美元，同捷克共和国进行交易。他聘请了包括前国防部长在内的前捷克官员。他甚至被任命为泽曼的特别经济顾问。\\n\\n反过来，泽曼也成了北京的重要支持者，遏制了国内对中国影响力的反对意见，力挺中国的事业。他公开支持中国对台湾的主张——台湾是一个实施民主制度的岛屿，北京声称它是自己的领土。当习近平访问捷克时，警察试图让抗议者远离他的视线；一些人后来指责警方使用暴力镇压他们。一位著名的犹太大屠杀幸存者的家人说，在他的外甥与达赖喇嘛会面之后，泽曼撤回了原计划颁发给他的奖章。中国认为流亡宗教领袖达赖喇嘛是反叛分子。\\n\\n习近平2016年访问布拉格所到之处，都有大巴载着中国支持者出现。 Filip Singer/EPA, via

       " '北京——几十年来，中国严格限制女性生孩子的数量。现在则开始鼓励她们多生。进展并不顺利。\\n\\n新的运动使得人们担心，中国可能会从一个极端走向另一个极端，让女性生更多孩子。有一些省份已经收紧了对堕胎的控制，或者加大了离婚的难度。\\n\\n官方报纸《人民日报》本周在一篇社论里表示，“说白了，生娃不只是家庭自己的事，也是国家大事”，结果在网上引发了广泛的批评和争论。\\n\\n北京一家医院的产科病房，摄于2013年。提高出生率的运动引发了人们的担忧，担心中国可能会从一个极端走向另一个极端。 Andy Wong/Associated Press\\n\\n“在普通人、学者当中，对该政策已经达成了足够多的共识，”北京的研究机构中国与全球化智库(Center for China and Globalization)理事长王辉耀表示。“取消这项政策只是时间问题。”\\n\\n国家健康卫生委员会在一份声明中表示，去年春天在北京举行的人大会议上提出了结束二孩政策的计划，其他措施目前似乎也正在考虑中。\\n\\n专家们表示，政府除了鼓励生育，没有其他选择。中国是世界上人口最多的国家，拥有超过14亿人口，目前它正在经历快速老龄化，日渐萎缩的劳动力规模难以支撑越来越长寿且日益增长的老龄人口。据报道，一些省份已经出现了养老金支付困难。\\n\\n目前尚不清楚取消二孩限制能带来多大的效果。跟许多国家一样，中国城市里受过教育的女性在追求事业的同时，纷纷推迟要孩子。包括不断上涨的住房和教育成本在内的经济压力，也迫使年轻夫妇疲于应付。\\n\\n今年5月，一对情侣在上海拍婚纱照。中国一些地方的官员提议为年轻家庭提供新的福利，包括税收减免和住房、教育补贴。 Johannes Eisele/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\n独生子女政策还导致了出生的男孩多于女孩。由于重男轻女的传统，一些父母因为是女儿而堕胎，尽管这种选择性堕胎不合法。由于该因素及其他因素的影响，现在结婚和生育的女性数量也减少了。\\n\\n根据人口学家何亚福的说法，未来十年，20至39岁的女性人数预计将减少3900多万，从2.02亿增减至1.63亿，何亚福著有一本关于中国计划生育影响的书。\\n\\n“如果不采取措施鼓励生育，未来中国人口将大幅下降，”他说。\\n\\n在全国性政策变化出台前，地方政府已经采取措施促进生育。\\n\\n中国东北的辽宁省是全国出生率最低的省份之一，上个月，官员为年轻家庭提供了一系列新的福利，包括减税、住房和教育补贴，以及更长的产假和陪产假，还有对医院和幼儿园的投资。\\n\\n在东南部的江西省，政府采取了更为令人反感的方法，它重新制定了关于女性何时可以堕胎的指导方针。尽管这些规则并不新鲜，但此举令人们担心当局打算更严格地执行它们，其中包括要求怀孕超过14周的妇女在堕胎前获得医疗人员的三次签名。\\n\\n上月在上海的中国孕婴童展，国家卫生健康委员会说，有两个孩子的家庭比例从2013年的36%攀升至今天的51%。 Giulia Marchi for The New York Times\\n\\n有关官员说，这些指导方针的目的是执法，禁止夫妇因为想生男孩而流产女性胎儿——尽管他们承认保持官方出生率也是一个考虑因素。\\n\\n还有两个省份已经收紧对夫妻离婚的要求，称这些改变的部分原因是为了保持新增人口的可能性。\\n\\n这些措施重新令人们抱怨长期以来政府对女性身体实施令人反感控制。\\n\\n7月，在江西详细介绍了它出台的堕胎指导原则后，一位用户在新浪微博上抱怨说：“您的子宫已被监控。”\\n\\n1979年，为了减缓人口增长，加强当时刚刚开始的经济繁荣，中国开始引入“独生子女”政策。共产党建立了一个庞大的“计划生育”工作者官僚机构来执行这项政策，有时还会通过暴力执行。农村地区的抵抗情绪特别严重，部分原因是农村偏爱可以帮助从事农业工作的男孩。\\n\\n1984年，政府允许第一胎是女孩的农村夫妇生二胎，少数民族还有其他例外。2013年，政府认识到人口老龄化的影响，允许父母都是独生子女的家庭生二胎。两年后，从2016年1月1日开始，限制变为所有夫妇都可以生二胎。\\n\\n在线旅游公司携程首席执行官孙洁，该公司为有子女或考虑生育的员工提供福利，关于中国的生育率，“我们真的需要有紧迫感，”她说。 Giulia Marchi for The New York Times\\n\\n那一年的出生率跃升，反映了大量家庭都渴望二胎，但生育率在2017年再次下降，促使政府重新考虑其计划。\\n\\n最近的一项政府研究估计，从2020年到2035年，中国的劳动力可能会减少1亿人，然后从2035年到2050年再减少1亿人。它警告，这会给“经济和社会发展”，以及预算资源和环境带来压力。\\n\\n经济上的迫切需要促使一些私营公司自行采取行动。\\n\\n携程公司是全球第二大在线旅游公司，仅次于Priceline，它为父母提供了各种福利，例如怀孕期间的通勤出租车，以及员工子女达到入学年龄后的奖金。上个月，它宣布它还将为一些管理层人员提供冻卵费用补贴——据说它是第一家这样做的中国公司。\\n\\n该公司首席执行官孙洁表示，携程的行为是出于社会责任感，但也是由于经济因素：人口下降会伤害经济增长。携程的联合创始人梁建章写过一本书，警告中国人口结构变化对技术创新的影响。\\n\\n孙洁在公司上海总部接受采访时说：“我们这一代人只有一个孩子，所以在他们看来独生子女是正常的。”\\n\\n“我认为我们真的需要有自上而下和自下而上的紧迫感，鼓励家庭恢复健康的出生率，”她补充说。\\n\\n2015年在北京，一个新妈妈和她的孩子、月嫂在一起。很多中国人担心费用和孩子所需的照料，不愿意生二胎。 Adam Dean for The New York Times\\n\\n在对提问的书面回答中，国家卫生健康委员会表示“二孩”政策正在起作用。虽然去年的总出生人数下降至1720万，而2016年的出生人数接近1790万，但有两个孩子的家庭比例从2013年的36%攀升至今天的51%。\\n\\n该委员会承认，夫妻在生育第二个孩子方面面临许多障碍，并表示政府正在制定税收和教育等政策，以解决这些问题。\\n\\n“为了消除群众的顾虑，维持生育率，我们需要关注生养子女的实际困难，”它说。\\n\\n人口统计专家警告说，改变人们的生育行为是很困难的。\\n\\n悉尼新南威尔士大学(University of New South Wales)教授，中国儿童福利专家尚晓媛表示，政府需要帮助最有可能生育第二胎或第三胎的家庭。\\n\\n“应该给予这种家庭更多的支持，并应更多投资儿童福利：包括早期教育和母婴健康，”她说。\\n\\n更好的福利和服务不足以说服每个人。\\n\\n在北京的会计师孙忠悦27岁，正怀着第一胎，她说，她已经不考虑生二胎，并援引工作场所歧视、教育成本和大家庭的社会压力作为论据。\\n\\n虽然在中国，祖父母和外祖父母经常帮忙照顾孩子，但孙忠悦这一代人大都是独生子女，他们预计要轮流照顾年迈的父母。\\n\\n“虽然老人可以帮我们看孩子，但是因为老人身体不好了就看不了啊。所以不会要二胎，”她在去政府办公室领取产妇护理报销时说。\\n\\n“因为培养孩子就有压力啊，”她还说。“钱的支持、人力的支持。”',\n",
       " '彩虹邨(Choi Hung Estate)是香港的一个公共租住房屋小区，这里的篮球场看起来本该是一个打球的好场所。这些涂着蓝橙黄红鲜艳色彩的球场，位于小区两层楼停车场的充满阳光的屋顶，球场的三个边被同样五颜六色的高层公寓楼环绕。\\n\\n但是，这里有这么多的人在站着、坐着、躺着拍照，以至于很难把一场球打下去。\\n\\n香港有近一半人口居住在政府提供的公屋，这些屋邨已成为Instagram上最受欢迎的目的地。当地人和游客纷纷涌入位于香港各处的公屋邨，摆姿势拍摄用以上传社交媒体的完美照片，也在这个过程中激怒了当地的居民。\\n\\n这些屋邨还吸引了专业摄影者的兴趣，它们被引人注目地用在营销活动的材料上，甚至还出现在韩国男子流行音乐团体Seventeen的音乐视频中。\\n\\n不难理解为什么彩虹邨这样的地方特别受Instagram用户的喜爱。其他的屋邨也适合拍出同样赏心悦目的照片：一个屋邨里的明亮蓝色建筑构成引人入迷的同心圆，另一个由圆柱形建筑组成，建筑内部像是巨大的螺旋弹簧玩具“机灵鬼”(Slinky)。\\n\\n“这是视觉艺术，吸引着人们的注意力，”38岁的威廉·梁(William Leung)说，他自称是“公屋迷”，也是一位狂热的摄影爱好者，最近出版了一本关于香港公屋的摄影集。\\n\\n和许多建筑一样，上镜头的大都是漂亮的外表。但许多拿着自拍杆来这里的游客没有意识到的是，这些屋邨是公共住房的奇迹，在世界上最昂贵的城市之一，为数百万人提供了经济适用的住所。\\n\\n“你看到彩虹邨在Instagram上走红，那纯粹是基于其表观美学，”克里斯托弗·德伍尔夫(Christopher DeWolf)说，他是从事城市与建筑报道的记者，著有《借来的空间：现代香港的夹缝生活》(Borrowed Spaces: Life Between the Cracks in Modern Hong Kong)一书。\\n\\n“香港的许多公共住房都是在现代主义成为一种日益受欢迎的建筑形式的时代建造的，”33岁的德伍尔夫说。他说，这些建筑清晰的轮廓和匀称的线条使它们成为“非常醒目”的摄影背景。\\n\\n这些屋邨也为人们提供了香港的一个不同景观，照片上的香港通常拍的是其标志性的天际线。\\n\\n人们在彩虹邨拍照。 Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times\\n\\n“在住着这么多人的公屋邨里摆姿势拍照，给人以处于世界中心的感觉，”建筑助理赛勒斯·黄(Cyrus Wong)说，他在研究公屋在Instagram上的流行，这是他硕士论文的一部分。\\n\\n有时候，这些自拍者们在篮球赛还在进行时就站在球场上摆姿势拍照。\\n\\n23岁的文森特·杨(Vincent Yeung)几乎一直住在彩虹邨。不久前一个周六的下午，他是球场上唯一一个打球的人，其他的场地则挤满了拍照者。\\n\\n“这里拍照的人太多，”他说。“我的朋友们都去其他地方打球了。”\\n\\n几个月前，他在打一场三人赛时，有一对情侣非要坐在场地中间拍照。果然，一个球打偏了砸到他们，杨说，这对情侣勃然大怒，咒骂他和他的朋友。\\n\\n“如果我们要是说他们吧，就会说我们搞歧视，”他指的是来彩虹邨参观的内地游客。“但是如果我们不说他们——哎，我们正在这里打球！真是不好办。”\\n\\n在公屋邨，没有明令禁止拍照，但是进入楼内需要密码。\\n\\n“如果近乎一半的人口都住在公屋里，那么它就成了一种日常背景，而不是被分开或被孤立的东西，”香港大学建筑系副主任邵达辉(Eric Schuldenfrei)说。\\n\\n彩虹邨，一名女子在晾晒食物。 Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times\\n\\n公屋在香港历史上发挥着重要作用，政府的政策通常反映的是这座城市的经济发展状况。\\n\\n大约从1937年到1950年间，大批难民涌入香港，这是由于第二次世界大战前日本入侵中国以及后续的中国内战所致。香港努力接纳新移民，成千上万的人们最终住进了杂乱无序、拥挤的棚户区，里面挤满寮屋。\\n\\n1953年圣诞节，一场大火席卷了寮屋区，使得5.3万人在一夜之间无家可归，政府被迫介入。临时避难所以及短期安置中心最终被永久性公屋邨所取代。其中首批就包括彩虹邨，它建于1964年，住着大约4.3万人。\\n\\n根据研究机构团结香港基金(Our Hong Kong Foundation)一份有关 住房政策的报告 ，香港“有一个巨大的公共部门住房项目，其规模在自由市场经济体中前所未见”。“不可否认的是，香港政府是这片土地上独大的地主、房屋开发商和运营商。”\\n\\n德伍尔夫说，像彩虹邨这样旧的公屋邨让人们回想起过去那个房价远可承受的时代。其中很多都建于20世纪六七十年代。六十年代，香港转型为蓬勃发展的制造业中心，到了七十年代，经济开始腾飞。\\n\\n“回想起来，这里面有一种乐观精神，”德伍尔夫说，“是对于一个更简单时代的向往，当时似乎每个香港人都有机会成功。”\\n\\n五十多岁的彭(K. Pang)是一名退休公务员，最近刚和他的家人回到彩虹邨，他在那里度过了大部分的童年时光。\\n\\n看着自己的孩子留影拍照，彭先生说：“看到这样一处旧的公屋邨如今吸引着游客，感觉很怀旧。”他说，在过去，像这样的公屋邨是和犯罪联系在一起的，但现在他却发现它们变成了受人喜欢的旅游景点。\\n\\n彩虹邨这样的公屋建于香港的经济腾飞期。 Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times\\n\\n25岁的尼尔森·袁(Nelson Yuen)一直住在彩虹邨，他看到自家后院里拿相机拍照的游客数量在减少。他完全没有被这种行为惹怒，反而决定和女朋友摆个照相摊，以每张40港币的价格出售拍立得相片。\\n\\n“我觉得这很好，把这里变成了一个旅游景点，”他说。“这比这里没有人要好。”',\n",

       " '2017年1月，导演朱浩伟宣布，要为他改编自《疯狂的亚洲富人》(Crazy Rich Asians)的电影公开招募亚洲和亚裔美国演员。他在西好莱坞家中的厨房里录制了一段视频（你可以看到背景中的冰箱），这则网络英雄帖称，有意加入其全亚裔阵容的人——从有志成为演员的人，到“身藏才华的有型人物”，去社交媒体上发布一段两分钟的视频。“我们正在找你，”他笑着说。\\n\\n对于亚洲和亚裔美国观众来说，这部将于8月15日上映的电影不只是一部哈雷彗星式的电影——在《喜福会》之前，还有1961年的《花鼓歌》(The Flower Drum Song)，然后还有什么？大家存在一种热切的希望，那就是如果这部电影成功了，可能会避免又一段25年的空白。制片人爱用“参照对象”（跟其推销的电影点子类似的近期作品）来帮助他们向电影公司兜售自己的想法，拿到预算。对于《疯狂的亚洲富人》（又译：《摘金奇缘》）的制片人来说，他们手里完全没有参照对象。未来的众多以亚洲为主题的电影希望《疯狂的亚洲富人》可以成为那个“参照对象”。\\n\\n当朱浩伟在网上发出选角令时，对于亚洲演员来说，无论是否心怀大志，这都可谓天赐之物。忘掉起点缀作用的龙套吧，在这部片子里，亚裔演员扮演所有的角色：无论是浪漫的主角和讨喜的配角、充满喜剧色彩的小角色，还是路人甲乙丙丁。地球上有超过40亿的亚洲人，为这部片子选角能有多难呢？\\n\\n事实证明，非常难。好演员倒是不缺。但随着对角色的考虑和演员的选择，各位制作人就亚裔的身份问题发生了争执。亚洲人可以扮演亚裔美国人吗？马来西亚人可以演新加坡人吗？有着白人妈妈或者爸爸的亚洲男人呢？他能参加角逐吗？\\n\\n在谁可以演谁上。2016年，“ #StarringJohnCho ”（#赵约翰主演）运动凸显了好莱坞电影中没有亚裔男主角的现象，该运动重新构想了《火星救援》(The Martian)、《复仇者联盟2：奥创纪元》(Avengers: Age of Ultron)等热门大片如果由这位才华横溢的韩裔美国男演员来主演，会是什么样子。上个月， 在今天的好莱坞，最具争议性的辩论仍然集中由于要在片中饰演一名跨性别男子而引发跨性别演员和活动人士的强烈反对，斯嘉丽·约翰逊(Scarlett Johansson)退出了传记片《摩擦和拖拽》(Rub & Tug)的拍摄。好莱坞因为“洗白”而受到越来越多的批评，也就是让白人演员来演亚洲人角色的做法。想想蒂尔达·斯文顿(Tilda Swinton)在《奇异博士》(Doctor Strange)里扮演的古一法师，或者约翰逊（再一次）在《攻壳机动队》(Ghost in the Shell)里饰演的草薙素子。\\n\\n《电影不平等——好莱坞演员和种族主义》(Reel Inequality: Hollywood Actors and Racism)一书的作者王岚芝(Nancy Wang Yuen)说，很多争议本来不会那么焦灼，“如果有足够角色的话。”她还说：“我们不应该为残羹剩饭大打出手。我们应该为系统的扩展而奋斗，这样所有人都可以获得角色。”\\n\\n亨利·戈尔丁饰演的尼克。 Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.\\n\\n在前不久的一个早晨，朱浩伟来到他位于西好莱坞的家中，讲述了他在打造全亚裔演员阵容过程中的乐趣和挣扎。他穿着白色棒球帽和灰色T恤，谈起自己如何招募那些传奇人物（如杨紫琼）、相对不出名的人（亨利·戈尔丁[Henry Golding])、亚洲明星（新加坡的谢宛谕）和亚裔美国新秀（奥卡菲娜[Awkwafina]）。\\n\\n朱浩伟还解释了为什么他一开始就从如此广泛的范围内选角，不仅依靠通常的洛杉矶和纽约选角电话，还在五大洲搜索，开设了在线公开电话。“我们只是不想错过任何人，”他说。“我希望这成为亚洲演员的《复仇者联盟》(Avengers)。”\\n\\n搜索始于2013年，当时制片人尼娜·雅克布森（Nina Jacobson，《饥饿游戏》[The Hunger Games]）、布拉德·辛普森（Brad Simpson，《姿态》[Pose]）和约翰·皮诺蒂（John Penotti，《夺命手术》[Awake]）获得了凯文·关这部书的拍摄权。在故事中，纽约大学的美籍华裔教授雷切尔与她在伦敦读书出身的教授男友尼克一同前往他的出生地新加坡。雷切尔一到那里就发现了两件事：尼克的冷冰冰的母亲埃莉诺认为自己比雷切尔高一等，而尼克——以及他的家人——富有得令人厌恶而且无聊。\\n\\n事实证明，甚至在这本书上市之前，就有关于选角的问题。凯文·关表示，一个想把这本书拍成电影的制片人建议他把雷切尔写成白人。凯文·关拒绝了。\\n\\n“这并不让我感到惊讶，”最终饰演雷切尔的美国华裔女演员吴恬敏说，她一直都在抨击好莱坞的洗白。“我很高兴凯文坚持立场。对某些事情说不，这需要很大的勇气，特别是你会害怕，如果不答应，一切都可能从手中溜走。”\\n\\n在早期阶段，雅各布森和辛普森心目中有一些特定的演员，比如杨紫琼，她是所有人心目中埃莉诺的理想人选。与剧组大多数演员不同，杨紫琼曾经出演过数十部全亚裔演员的电影，如成龙经典的《警察故事3：超级警察》和奥斯卡获奖影片《卧虎藏龙》，所以，在某些方面，这并不是什么新鲜事。但那些都不是好莱坞的影片。“对我来说，在这里看到一个全亚洲演员班底是非常重要的，”她说。“25年？我甚至不明白为什么花了这么长时间。”\\n\\n至于其他角色，制片人们去向与亚洲演员有联系的资深选角导演寻求帮助，比如加拿大的欧阳宝屏（《功夫王国》[The Forbidden Kingdom]）。他们还去看了一群纽约和伦敦的舞台剧演员，并与一些世界顶级戏剧学校接洽，特别是在寻找饰演尼克的演员期间。“通常选角期间，如果想捧一个新人，你会去看各校的大牌戏剧专业，”雅克布森说。“但他们说，我们已经很多年没有男性亚裔毕业生了。”\\n\\n当朱浩伟宣布他的公开热线时，数以千计的视频涌了进来。来自美国、新加坡和其他地方的职业演员与那些认为自己没什么可以失去的业外人士一起前来试镜。\\n\\n有望成功的人选包括雪莉·高(Cheryl Koh)，她更为人知的身份是YouTube歌手，艺名雪莉·K(Cheryl K)，她的视频获得了超过100万的观看。尽管她非常努力想要得到一个角色，什么角色都行，但她只得到了很短的亮相机会，她清唱杰西·J(Jessie J)的《妈妈最懂》(Mamma Knows Best)的视频片段打动了影片制作人员，让她演唱开场字幕时的歌曲——普通话和英文版本的“披头士”金曲《金钱》(Money)。\\n\\n“当我听说乔希望我做这件事时，简直无法停止尖叫，”她说。\\n\\n演员阵容很快变得越来越国际化。来自英国的嘉玛·陈(Gemma Chan)和陆思敬；来自澳大利亚的克里斯·彭(Chris Pang)和瑞米·许(Remy Hii)；来自新加坡的方展发、谢宛谕和其他一些演员；来自马来西亚的钱信伊和杨紫琼；来自中国的卢燕和佳思敏·陈(Jasmine Chen)。妮可·桑托斯(Nico Santos)是在菲律宾度过童年，然后前往美国，在百味超市(Superstore)中出演角色；钱信伊出生于马来西亚，定期出演《每日秀》(The Daily Show)，之后到澳大利亚上学。美国出生的演员包括来自底特律的郑肯(Ken Jeong)；皇后区的奥卡菲娜；以及弗吉尼亚州里士满的吴恬敏。\\n\\n“郑肯必须飞往吉隆坡，只是为了几天的拍摄，报酬也不算多，”雅克布森说。“但他说，我愿意在这里饰演你给我的任何角色。”\\n\\n由于演员来自世界各地，电影制作人们对他们可以扮演什么角色有了一些顾虑。当然，口音是问题之一。不管由谁来扮演尼克，他都必须有英国口音，因此许多中国的票房明星都不能考虑。\\n\\n然后，尼克的朋友和家人必须有新加坡口音。“这是我会说的唯一一种口音，”在新加坡长大的钱信伊说。 “我不知道你有没有见过很多带这种口音的人，但是这么说吧，它是非常有特色的。”\\n\\n由于大部分拍摄都在新加坡进行，所以需要尽可能招募更多新加坡人。制片人说，如果做不到的话，他们想知道，什么地方可以让非新加坡人来饰演新加坡人的角色。\\n\\n“我们肯定总会想起《艺伎回忆录》(Memoires of a Geisha)，”雅克布森说，她指的是2005年那部由三位中国著名女演员饰演日本女人的电影。与《疯狂的亚洲富人》不同，那部由罗伯·马歇尔(Rob Marshall)执导，根据亚瑟·高登(Arthur Golden)的书改编的电影，是一部历史剧，发生在第二次世界大战前后的日本。\\n\\n最后，YouTube上的希望之星中只有几个人参与了《疯狂的亚洲富人》——这边在发短信的戏里放一个女人，那边放一个伴郎。但现在，朱浩伟说，他拥有“能说英语的亚洲人的最佳人才库”。\\n\\n最后一位被雇用的演员是亨利·戈尔丁，他为尼克试镜。简历上的他非常完美。他英俊，很有领袖魅力。他出生在马来西亚，母亲是马来西亚伊班族人，父亲是英国白人；他在伦敦长大，在那里得到了这个角色所必需的英国口音；然后，他人生的大部分时间都在亚洲度过，担任BBC和探索频道(Discovery Channel)的旅游节目主持人。\\n\\n他之前从未当过演员，事实上，这似乎只会为他的故事平添一丝灰姑娘的魅力，事情是这样的：再过几个月就开拍了，但他们还没找到尼克的人选，剧组在马来西亚的一位会计对制片人提了一句关于这位性感的旅游节目主持人的事，“所有女孩都迷恋他，”从那时起，戈尔丁开始被纳入考虑范围。\\n\\n钟洁咪很快就收回了自己的评论——“我真诚地为今年早些时候发表的无知评论感到遗憾，”她发推文说——并且向戈尔丁道了歉。\\n\\n“我认为他们质疑选择我的动机是公平的，”戈尔丁告诉我。“这让制片公司和让创造这个故事的所有人都知道了，人们正在看着。”\\n\\n即便如此，他说，“我从来没有觉得自己有一半白人血统就不适合这个角色。我一直认为自己是亚洲人，所以我对此没有丝毫不安。我更关心自己能不能演好。”\\n\\n朱浩伟承认，有一段时间，对选角的质疑令他感到不安，尤其是关于戈尔丁的问题。“然后我意识到我只是对那些觉得自己受到了伤害的人生气。他们和我一样见识过好莱坞的洗白，眼睁睁看着角色从手里溜走，因为有人说亚洲男人不能成为这个或那个的主角。”\\n\\n王岚芝说，目前大部分的洗白出自漫画和漫威电影，它们“使用那些东方主义修辞，不仅用在过去的亚洲人身上，也用在未来的亚洲人身上。但好莱坞并不知道如何将亚洲人或亚裔美国人纳入其中。感觉就是他们想要我们的样子、我们的故事和我们的武术，但他们不想要亚洲人。”\\n\\n好莱坞上一部以亚洲演员为主的影片是1993年的《喜福会》。 Hollywood Pictures\\n\\n随着越来越多的人谈论选角多样性并举出洗白的例子，朱浩伟看到了积极的发展，特别是对于亚裔美国人来说。本周Netflix将开播《致所有我曾爱过的男孩》(To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before)，这是一部由越南裔美国人陈东兰(Lana Condor)主演的成长故事。还有，8月24日，在 #StarringJohnCho 将这位演员奉为“我们值得拥有的明星”两年之后，一部名为《网络迷踪》(Searching)的惊悚片将由……没错……赵约翰主演。\\n\\n“如果我们在第一个周末有不错的表现，不同的制片公司就会投拍大约六部以亚裔美国人为主角的电影，”朱浩伟说。“这不是绿灯。所有人都在等着看这部影片做得怎么样。但如果这部反响好，我们立刻会有更多机会。如果不好，我们就必须再来一次。”',\n",
       " '通过仿若一条Instagram时间线般现代的方式，《疯狂的亚洲富人》重温了简·奥斯汀(Jane Austen)就“有意娶妻的多金男”这一主题给出的永恒普世真理。这一次涉及的男人是尼克·杨（Nick Young，亨利·戈尔丁[Henry Golding]饰），某新加坡地产家族的优秀后裔。影片开场就表明了他的财富规模——他的母亲在伦敦一家时髦酒店受到经理侮辱，于是干脆当着他的面把酒店买了下来。\\n\\n尼克很清楚自己想和谁结婚：瑞切尔·朱（Rachel Chu，吴恬敏饰），她是纽约大学经济学教授，在皇后区长大。她和尼克已经相恋一年，显然非常般配，至少在曼哈顿是如此。但当他们回到新加坡出席一场婚礼时，瑞切尔发现自己受到老一代人反感的审视，以及潜在竞争对手的恶毒狙击。\\n\\n所有浪漫喜剧要依赖核心伴侣走向最终幸福之路上的障碍。由凯文·关(Kevin Kwan)宏大而迷人的小说改编的《疯狂的亚洲富人》，是一部充满活力的热闹影片，它在传统和个人主义之间、在内心愿望和家庭责任之间、在疯狂的财富和精明的向上流动之间设置一系列冲突，它们更多是在笑声中得到解决，而不是在泪水里。片中有一连串阴谋和一两个夸张的大爆发，但没有什么能够破坏欢快的气氛。\\n\\n影片场景炫丽——就算新加坡有什么地方不美，我们在这部片子里也看不到——音乐很棒，食物包括家里的包点、街头的小吃和豪华的宴会菜肴。但这个派对的关键当然是客人名单。有人指出，这是长期以来第一部主要由亚洲和亚裔美国演员参演的好莱坞电影，而这个观点还是低估了演员阵容的多元化，无论是他们的血统还是流行文化背景。他们当中包括过去25年来最优秀的国际影星之一杨紫琼；滑稽美国喜剧的重要人物郑肯（他的演艺生涯并不比杨紫琼短多少）；还有近年来的嘻哈艺人、演员、网红奥卡菲娜(Awkwafina)。\\n\\n这只是一个小小的样本。凯文·关的书自2013年出版之后畅销不衰，已经有了两部续作，原书有500多页，包括脚注、家谱和足以组成一本电话簿的人物列表。它的题外话和支线情节可以轻松改编成一两季的电视剧，而这部由朱浩伟执导的电影可能会让人感觉有些匆忙和局限。有的地方戏太多，有的地方则不够。\\n\\n尽管如此，影片还是会让你乐在其中，只是对可怜的瑞切尔来说就不是那么回事了。在和即将结婚的一对情侣——尼克的发小科林（Colin，克里斯·彭[Chris Pang]饰）和未婚妻阿拉明塔（Araminta，水野索诺亚[Sonoya Mizuno]饰）——做了一次愉快的短途旅行之后，家族纷争和一些鸡毛蒜皮的蠢行开始愈演愈烈。瑞切尔遇到了尼克的前女友阿曼达（Amanda，陆思敬饰），她不是表面看上去的盟友。尼克迷人的堂妹阿斯特丽德（Astrid，嘉玛·陈[Gemma Chan]饰）要好相处一些，她的婚姻问题是影片中最完整的支线情节。她的丈夫迈克尔（Michael，方展发饰）和瑞切尔一样，是个局外人；妻子的金钱和地位带给他不安全感，使得他们的婚姻有可能成为一个警世故事。\\n\\n左起：在片中的杨紫琼、亨利·戈尔丁与吴恬敏。 Sanja Bucko/Warner Bros.\\n\\n每当尼克的母亲埃莉诺（Eleanor，杨紫琼饰）的视线落到瑞切尔的方向，就会有更严重的麻烦。（尼克的父亲正在出差。）她的判断似乎是严厉而不公平的，但她也拥有无可否认的庄严，对家庭、权力和自己身份的认真，显得既高尚又残忍。《疯狂的亚洲富人》无疑是站在自由选择和真爱的一边，但对其他价值观的分量和持久性也表达了些许肯定。\\n\\n总的来说，影片是希望给人带去一段欢乐时光。它毫不掩饰地赞美奢华与金钱，伴随着隐约的阶级冲突，但更多是关于对财富的渴望而不是嫉妒或愤怒，而且发生在一个奇迹般地摆脱了历史和政治的亚洲。瑞切尔疯疯癫癫的朋友吴培林（Peik Lin Goh，音，奥卡菲娜饰）以及她疯疯癫癫的父母（郑肯和许静雯饰）提供了令人放松的喜剧色彩，他们的暴发户气息与杨家的贵族傲慢形成鲜明对比。而在那个家族中，不是所有人都像埃莉诺那样有着帝王般的高贵，或者像她的儿子那样亲切。家族中有一群风趣的阿姨和一个机智的同性恋表兄（尼可·桑托斯[Nico Santos]饰），后者由于是个颇为烦人的俗套形象，相对没那么有意思。\\n\\n你也可以将这个人物视为一种自觉的复古——是这部电影狡猾而迷人的老派气息的一部分。在不曝露任何明显的怀旧情绪的情况下，《疯狂的亚洲富人》向过去、向东方表达了好感，以一种让人联想起经典小说和电影的方式，让一个由等级和预设角色定义的世界浮现出来。在这其中，最激烈的浪漫冲动与尼克和瑞切尔相对乏味的爱情故事关系不大，更多是与无尽的奢华和王朝权势的诱惑有关。这一点，大概还是相当现代的。',\n",
       " '本案看起来是一个熟悉的故事，但当事人的性别颠过来了：世界知名的纽约大学日耳曼文学和比较文学女教授阿维塔尔·罗奈尔(Avital Ronell)，被发现对自己之前的男研究生尼姆罗德·莱特曼(Nimrod Reitman)进行性骚扰。\\n\\n经过长达11个月的教育法修正案第九条(Title IX)调查发现，被一位同事称为“当今世上为数不多的哲学家明星之一”的罗内尔，要对身体和语言上的性骚扰负责，她的行为“频繁到足以改变莱特曼学习环境之条款与条件”。大学暂停了罗内尔在即将到来的新学年的教职。\\n\\n根据《纽约时报》拿到的第九条调查最终报告的摘录，莱特曼说她对自己进行了长达三年的性骚扰，并且公开了数十封电子邮件，她在邮件里称他为“我最宠爱的人”“甜蜜可人的宝贝儿”“猎鸡鸡犬”和“我惊人的美丽的尼姆罗德”。\\n\\n在“#我也是”运动对性行为不端的反思中，这起案子给女性主义发起了一个挑战——当她们自己行为不端时，又该如何回应。此案所带来的反应已在学界掀起了轩然大波。\\n\\n就在该校于今年春天作出最后的保密决定后不久，一群来自世界各地的学者，包括一些著名的女性主义者，给纽约大学写了一封信，为罗内尔辩护。署名排在第一位的，是《性别困惑》(Gender Trouble)一书的作者、当今最有影响力的女性主义学者之一的朱迪斯·巴特勒(Judith Butler)。\\n\\n“虽然我们无法看到这份机密卷宗，但我们都与罗内尔教授有着多年的密切接触，”这些教授在一份6月发表在一个哲学博客上的草拟信函中写道。“我们都看到了她与学生们的关系，而且我们当中一些人知道究竟是谁发起了这场针对她的恶毒攻击。”\\n\\n批评人士认为，这封信跟过去那些为权势男性的辩护如出一辙，把重点放在了事件对罗内尔的声誉和人格力量可能造成的损害上。\\n\\n教授们写道：“我们可以证明罗内尔教授的优雅、机敏和智识担当，我们要求，她理应得到与其国际地位和声誉相当的尊严。”\\n\\n现年34岁的莱特曼目前在哈佛作访问学者，他说罗内尔一再亲吻、触摸他，与他一起睡在他的床上，要求他躺在她的床上，握着他的手，不停地给他发短信、邮件、打电话，他若不做出回应，她就拒绝合作。莱特曼是同性恋，目前已与一名男子结婚；罗内尔也是一名同性恋。\\n\\n66岁的罗内尔对骚扰予以否认。“我们之间的通讯交流——莱特曼现在称之为性骚扰——是两个成年人，两个都拥有以色列背景的男同和女同，出于我们共同的学术背景和情感而产生的一种对浮夸的、坎普式的沟通方式的喜好，”她在给《纽约时报》的一份声明中写道。“在三年时间里，他一再要求、回应和鼓励这些交流。”\\n\\n从纽约大学毕业并获得博士学位两年后，莱特曼对其前导师发起了第九条投诉，指控她实施性骚扰、性侵犯、跟踪和报复。5月，纽约大学发现罗内尔对性骚扰负有责任，并排除了其他指控。\\n\\n莱特曼的律师唐纳德·克拉维特(Donald Kravet)表示，他和他的客户已经起草了针对纽约大学和罗内尔的诉讼书，现在正在考虑他们的选择。\\n\\n莱特曼和罗内尔对自己经历的描述都和其他“#我也是”故事相吻合：在莱特曼的回忆中，他害怕教授以及她可以对他施加的权力，经常要忍受让他感到受侵犯的行为。罗内尔在接受纽约大学第九条办公室问讯时称，莱特曼拼命吸引她的关注，要求获得她的指导，《纽约时报》获得了这份问讯记录。\\n\\n莱特曼说，自2012年春季他正式入学之前，问题就已经开始出现了。罗内尔邀请他和她一起在巴黎待了几天。他说，在他到达那天，她让他去卧室，在她午睡时朗诵诗歌给她听。\\n\\n“这已经令我产生警惕，”莱特曼说。“但我也想，好吧，我来都来了。最好不要小题大做。”\\n\\n然后，他说，她把他拉到了床上。\\n\\n“她把我的手放在她的乳房上，并把她的身体——她的臀部——压在我的胯部，”他说。“然后她亲吻我，吻我的手，吻我的身体。”那天晚上，类似的一幕再次出现，他说。\\n\\n他说，第二天早上他质问了她。\\n\\n“我说，你看，昨天那种事是不对的。你是我的导师，“他在接受采访时回忆道。\\n\\n当他到达纽约时，这种行为仍在继续，他说，2012年10月的桑迪飓风之后，罗内尔出现在他的公寓里，因为她家停电了。他说，尽管他提出反对，但她说服他，两人可以睡在一张床上。他说，接下来的一个星期，她每天晚上都在床上抚摸并亲吻他。\\n\\n“罗内尔教授彻底否认所有关于两人之间性接触的指控，”罗内尔的律师玛丽·多曼(Mary Dorman)在向第九条办公室提交的一份意见书中写道。罗尼尔说，在飓风过后，她只是在莱特曼的邀请下，在他家住了两晚。\\n\\n第九条办公室报告的结论是，没有足够的证据证明罗内尔对性侵犯负有责任，部分原因是没有其他人目睹两人在莱特曼的公寓或罗内尔巴黎房间内的互动。\\n\\n莱特曼还说，因为他抱怨她的行为，罗内尔对他进行了报复，其中包括为他写的例行推荐信，从而阻碍了他的工作前程。但是，第九条报告发现她为他写的推荐信“与她为其他学生写的推荐信类似”，而莱特曼也确实获得了两份研究生奖学金。\\n\\n罗内尔和一些支持她的人试图以熟悉的方式来诋毁原告，问他为什么过了这么长的时间才举报，还有，如果他真的有那么痛苦，他为什么看上去还同罗内尔非常亲密。也许，罗内尔说，他沮丧的是他不够聪明。\\n\\n“他的主要困境是他的写作缺乏连贯性，缺乏能得到认可的的论点，”2018年1月罗内尔在接受第九条办公室问讯时说。\\n\\n除了始终未公开宣布的停职，纽约大学还在调查与这位教授的信件有关的进一步报复行为指控。\\n\\n该大学发言人约翰·贝克曼(John Beckman)在致《纽约时报》的一份声明中写道，纽约大学对莱特曼所经历的事情表示“同情”。\\n\\n但是，贝克曼还说，“鉴于我们对他的指控作出了迅速、严肃和彻底的回应，我们认为他提出的针对本校提出的数百万美元诉讼是不合理、不公正的。”\\n\\n罗内尔和莱特曼都认为他们在这个“#我也是”故事中扮演了不适宜的角色。\\n\\n莱特曼说，他从未打算在这场关于性别的全国性讨论中成为任何形式的公众人物，而且他在该运动开始前就开始了自己的投诉。“这不是受‘#我也是’的启发，”他说。\\n\\n2018年3月，罗内尔尖刻地抱怨说，雷特曼喜欢“将我和那些最严重的掠夺性行为相提并论，那些事都是惯于追逐小明星的好莱坞大亨才干的。”',\n",
       " '奢华之旅可以通过两种方式体验到：付出高昂的费用或是付更少的钱。如果可以选择的话，你难道不会选择后者吗？\\n\\n当然，对于奢华之旅是什么，不同人的理解可能不尽相同。对一些人而言，它意味着带管家的酒店、高档的床单以及头等舱飞行；对另一些人而言，它意味着享用米其林三星餐厅、雇佣临时的私人导游，以及配备司机的专车。\\n\\n归根结底，重要的不是你如何定义高端旅行。重要的是，你并不是一定要为此支付高昂的价格。\\n\\n以下是一些可以在不牺牲奢华体验的同时，帮助你省钱的高端旅行目的地。\\n\\n巴塞罗那，圣心圣殿。 Alexander Spatari/Getty Images\\n\\n巴塞罗那\\n\\n想去巴塞罗那享受奢华假期，又不希望花太多钱？没问题，马德里一家高端旅行公司“进军西班牙和葡萄牙”(Made for Spain and Portugal)的创始人弗吉尼亚·伊鲁里塔(Virginia Irurita)说。“过去一年里，巴塞罗那正变得越来越能让旅客负担得起，以有限的预算进行一次高端旅行是可以实现的，”她说。\\n\\n伊鲁里塔的建议：\\n\\n\\n\\n何时前往：巴塞罗那的酒店在每年4月到10月之间价格最高。从11月到来年3月，价格至少会降低25%。很多五星级酒店也会在此淡季期间提供吸引人的套餐。\\n\\n布宜诺斯艾利斯的阳台。 Camila Arruda/Getty Images\\n\\n香港\\n\\n莱弗里的建议：\\n\\n何时前往：香港的酒店价格全年比较稳定，除了6月、7月和8月；这几个月是香港最湿热的时期，酒店价格会下降。但是，这并不是理想的参观时间，莱弗里说，除非你不介意雾气湿重的天气。\\n\\n从芝加哥肯珀大厦的41楼可以看到千禧公园、芝加哥美术馆和阿德勒天文馆。 Michelle Litvin for The New York Times\\n\\n步行或乘船：游览这座城市的理想方式是在里巷漫步并迷失其间。或去预定一次徒步旅行，比如 游览这座城市的理想方式是在里巷漫步并迷失其间。或去预定一次徒步旅行，比如 香港探险 (Little Adventures in Hong Kong)公司提供的最多五人参加的徒步游，由当地记者和厨师带领，价格为115美元。\\n\\n伦敦\\n\\n巴特勒的建议：\\n\\n\\n\\n何时前往：伦敦的酒店价格从每年5月到7月间骤增。但是，从9月初到2月底，价格会略微下降。如果你不怕冷，1月是旅行价格最便宜的时候。“酒店价格降到最低，餐厅、剧院和博物馆会提供优惠以在淡季促销，”巴特勒说。\\n\\n香港，人们在国际金融中心商场喝鸡尾酒。 Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times\\n\\n不要租车和乘出租车：在伦敦，带有专人司机的租车以及出租车可能一天会花费数百英磅。省钱、深度了解这座城市，并进行一些锻炼，这三者可以通过将步行作为你的主要交通方式同时得以实现。当去较远的地方时，可以依靠地铁。\\n\\n米兰\\n\\n但是他也说了，还是有一些省钱的方式的。\\n\\n菲尔纳迪的建议：\\n\\n何时前往：与一年中其他时间相比，每年11月与12月间，酒店价格要低至最多30%。这两个月也是菲尔纳迪更喜欢待在城内的时间。“气温温和，节日的装饰都布置了起来，气氛也很活跃，”他说。\\n\\n同时别错过米兰传统的餐前开胃酒时间，一般从晚上6:30开始，持续到8:30结束。通常点酒后会有免费的食物提供。\\n\\n伦敦，泰特现代艺术馆中的涡旋厅。 Andy Haslam for The New York Times\\n\\n孟买，照片中右边的建筑是Minara Masjid清真寺。 Poras Chaudhary for The New York Times\\n\\n孟买\\n\\n她的建议：\\n\\n何时前往：孟买的酒店自每年10月至次年4月中价格最高。此后价格会下降至少30%，直至9月末。但是考尔菲尔德说，5月和6月太热，7月和8月又是季风季节。“4月末和9月份是价格最友好以及最理想的旅行时间，”她说。此外，很多住处会在连住三晚及以上的情况下提供10%到15%的折扣。\\n\\n在集市和市场内购物：孟买的集市和市场上售有高质量且风格独特的商品，在那里你可以讨价还价。戈拉巴铜锣湾(Colaba Causeway)有几家卖时尚手工皮凉鞋的街边小店，“小偷集市”(Chor Bazaar)上有很多古董。\\n\\n像当地人一样出行：不要乘坐昂贵的酒店专车，出租车安全、便宜而且容易打到，Uber也很普及且价格适中。\\n\\n纽约市，大都会艺术博物館。 Todd Heisler/The New York Times\\n\\n纽约\\n\\n戈登的建议：\\n\\n何时前往：纽约酒店的房价从每年9月到11月的第一周，以及感恩节到新年期间最贵。房价在春夏两季也很高。但是，在11月初，以及1月到3月初，房价会降低约20%。纽约市的酒店产业是由商务旅行者带动的，因此高档酒店内工作日的每晚房价要比周末的房价贵150美元。\\n\\n文化消费很便宜：纽约一些最棒的旅游景点并不贵。 纽约一些最棒的旅游景点并不贵。 大都会艺术博物馆 (The Metropolitan Museum of Art)门票25美元，还可以在同日用来参观位于曼哈顿上城的 修道院艺术博物馆 (Met Cloisters)，以及步行十分钟以外的 布劳耶分馆 (Met Breuer)。纽约市全年还有一些免费的节日和街头集市，同时，中央公园(Central Park)、哈德逊河公园(Hudson River Park)以及巴特里公园(Battery Park)内都会举办许多免费的音乐会。\\n\\n巴黎，卢森堡公园。 Ed Alcock for The New York Times\\n\\n巴黎\\n\\n她的建议：\\n\\n何时前往：在每年的11月至次年4月期间前往巴黎可以享受到最优惠的酒店价格，这段时间的价格最低。如果提前几个月预定，一些高端酒店还会提供更大的优惠。\\n\\n吃得精明：在巴黎有名的餐厅吃午餐，这比吃晚餐要便宜得多。一些受欢迎的餐厅提供便宜的午市固定套餐。至于晚餐，希科克斯推荐去位于住宅区内的餐厅吃，例如南皮加勒(South Pigalle)，上玛黑(Haut Marais)和蒙马特(Montmartre)地区，在这些地方吃一顿配红酒的晚餐，人均花费在35欧至50欧之间。天气暖些的时候，带上法棍、奶酪、酥皮糕点以及红酒到卢森堡公园(Luxembourg Gardens)或其他公园内进行一次纵情但便宜的野餐。\\n\\n避免打车和租车：希科克斯最喜欢的探索巴黎的方式是步行。“通过步行，你可以充分欣赏到这座城市的美丽，而且它也确实是为步行者设计的，因为城市里到处都是步行小径和人行道，”她说。\\n\\n布宜诺斯艾利斯\\n\\n她的建议：\\n\\n文化消费很便宜：布宜诺斯艾利斯是微剧场运动中的一部分，在这里，小场馆们会在晚间上演一系列短剧。门票通常在每人10美元或更低。不要花钱去看游客云集且价格高昂的探戈舞演出，可以去参观米隆加舞会或是探戈舞厅，在那儿你能看到当地人跳舞，并能以137到219比索，也就是5到8美元的价格参与其中。\\n\\n纵情享用美食：在布宜诺斯艾利斯吃上一顿高质量的饭并不会很贵。比如说Parrillas餐厅就提供丰盛且价格公道的牛排，在很多受欢迎的餐厅内吃一顿带红酒的晚餐可能人均25美元都不到。\\n\\n乘坐出租车 或步行：出租车是一种安全且经济的出行方式；吉尔摩建议旅行者利用自己的酒店或餐厅来约电召出租车，那里的所有司机都注册过。她最喜欢的探索这座城市的方式是步行。“建筑、街道和当地人都是使得布宜诺斯艾利斯这座城市特别的地方，欣赏它最好的方式就是步行，”她说。\\n\\n芝加哥\\n\\n“你的钱能在这儿用很久，但这里还是有一些方法可以更精打细算地花这些钱，”她说。\\n\\n下面是欧文的建议：\\n\\n步行或乘地铁：不管是一年中的什么时候，芝加哥人都喜欢步行，霍夫曼推荐游客们也这么做。替代步行的还有名为L的芝加哥 捷运系统，这是一种高效且便宜的交通方式。\\n\\n墨西哥城，照片中前方的建筑是艺术宫。 The New York Times\\n\\n墨西哥城\\n\\n她的建议：\\n\\n何时前往：公司是墨西哥城旅游市场的主导，因此周末前往最合适，工作日的酒店价格可以是周末的两倍。价格也会在天气炎热的5月到9月间下降，但是鉴于天气太热，省这点钱可能并不值得。\\n\\n在墨西哥卷饼店吃饭也是一个选择：两到三个墨西哥卷饼外加葡萄酒的价格大约是每人5到10美元。\\n\\n乘坐优步：“优步(Uber)的价钱不高，也很好用，”阿维莱斯说。',\n",

       " '在这个节目中，加兹比触及了男性的脆弱——一度黑了毕加索，他在自己40多岁的时候和一名十来岁的女孩有过风流事。\\n\\n拥有艺术史学位的加兹比讲述了毕加索是如何为他们的这段关系辩护的，他说自己和那位名叫玛丽-特莉丝·沃尔特(Marie-Thérèse Walter)的女孩都正当盛年。加兹比怒气冲冲地说：“一个17岁的女孩绝不可能处在她的盛年。绝不！我才是盛年。”她今年40岁。\\n\\n研究人员在其中研究了男性和女性用户的“期许性”，其依据是在一个“热门、免费在线约会服务平台”上，统计近20万名在寻求异性伴侣的用户在一个月当中收到了多少条信息——以及在同样的评判标准下，那些发出信息的人的吸引力如何。\\n\\n研究人员们发现，男性的性吸引力在50岁时达到巅峰，而女性则在18岁时达到巅峰，随后开始下降。\\n\\n换句话说，和沃尔特与毕加索的年龄差距差不多。\\n\\n“女性的年龄梯度无疑让我们感到意外——既在于它从女性18岁开始到65岁的这段时间内稳定下降这一事实，也在于它下降得是如此急剧，”密歇根大学的社会学副教授、该研究作者伊丽莎白·布鲁赫(Elizabeth Bruch)说。\\n\\n这项研究并不反常。\\n\\n该研究结果与大型约会网站OkCupid于2010年公开的数据相呼应，在那份数据当中，该服务平台发现介于22岁到30岁之间的男性关注的几乎全部是比他们更年轻的女性。\\n\\nOkCupid还报告说，当男性的变老时，他会寻找相对越来越年轻的女性，但是他可以接受的年龄上限却仅仅停留在他自己的年龄上。\\n\\n“男性对于年轻的这种迷恋扰乱了约会市场，”OkCupid网站这样总结道。\\n\\n穴居人心态根深蒂固。\\n\\n米歇尔·德劳因(Michelle Drouin)是一名专注于技术与关系领域的发展心理学家，她对这一新的研究并不感到惊讶——部分原因是男性“遵循了交配的进化理论”，该理论认为年轻意味着生育能力，她说。\\n\\n尽管如此，德劳因指出也有其他理论表明“男性对于收入潜力更不感兴趣，而对外表的吸引力更感兴趣。”\\n\\n女人想要头脑，而男人则不关心。\\n\\n谈到收入潜力，布鲁赫还发现男性的教育水平越高，吸引力就越高。\\n\\n对女性而言，这一利好到本科学位就终结了——而且博士学位事实上会使得她们的吸引力降低。\\n\\n德劳因说这种教育水平上的动因，很可能跟“认为女性获得更高的学位就会更多地投入在工作而非情感与家庭”有关。\\n\\n人们的目标比较高（有可能太高了）。\\n\\n德劳因强调说，线上择偶者的偏好反映的是他们的渴求，这未必是他们在现实的生活中想要的东西。这项研究中一个关键的发现就是，大部分用户都会给吸引力高于自己的人发消息。确切地说，是比自己高出25%的人。\\n\\n这一数据反映的是“约会偏好的现实性”——换句话说就是和自己配不上的人约会，德劳因说。约会的现实通常不是这样。\\n\\n“在线约会者们发出的这些消息，可以比作是在拉斯维加斯玩的那种老虎机，”她说。“初期几乎不需要什么投资，但是结果却可能收获颇丰——所以为何不选择获得最大胜利的机会呢？”\\n\\n但话又说回来了，互联网不懂化学反应。\\n\\n“在现实的世界里，一个女人如果有研究生学历，知道你最喜欢的凯鲁亚克片段，会说好几种语言，或者还发现了治愈疾病的新方法，那她的魅力可能是难以抗拒的，”她说。“想想阿迈勒·克鲁尼(Amal Clooney)。”',\n",
       " '如果我的青年时期可以延长2.3年，我想用多出来的时间做下面这些事：\\n\\n• 去参加更多派对。最好是可供多年后在平淡派对上回忆的疯狂派对。\\n\\n• 健身（比如，在我死去之前至少练出一块腹肌）。我听说，这个目标在年轻时比较容易实现。\\n\\n• 多找几个爱情伴侣。最好是有腹肌的。\\n\\n• 早一点在事业阶梯上爬得更高一点。那很可能会增加我的收入，让我在经济上更有安全感。我可以用那些钱去参加更多派对，成为一个高档健身房的会员，甚至也许能在腹肌练习器上遇见一位恋爱对象。\\n\\n通常来讲，养孩子对你的健康、事业和参加派对的能力有很大影响。它的负担更可能由母亲而非父亲承担——这已经够糟的了。而女性结束没有孩子的年龄早于男性这一点，简直是雪上加霜。接着往下看，年龄差距越大，越有可能在老年时由女性照顾男性伴侣。\\n\\n这些数据令我愤怒，我给妈妈发了一条短信，说我打算找一个比我年轻得多的男人，弥补这种痛苦。妈妈回复说，“女人比男人更成熟。”我翻了个白眼。如果她的话算是实情，那也许是因为男人们知道自己可以在年纪更大的时候成家。所以为什么要着急长大呢？我还没来得及回复妈妈，她就又给我发来一条消息：“法国总统的婚姻是个例外，而且现在还不知道以后会发生什么。”够狠啊，妈妈。\\n\\n不过，她也许是对的。我改变了战术，安排和一个30岁的同龄人约会。他在布鲁克林一家酒吧的花园里坐着，等我去给我们俩要了两杯辣玛格丽特鸡尾酒。回来后，我问他在寻找什么。\\n\\n“你是什么意思？”\\n\\n“我的意思是，你是认真的吗？”\\n\\n他在阳光下向后靠去，微笑着说，“哦，不，不是。我不着急。”\\n\\n嗯。我的目光落在他的无袖T恤上。我想像着把我的饮料倒在上面的样子。我的朋友乔恩(Jon)告诉我，这些都是“侵入式想法”，谁都会有这种想法。这让我又开始想像把那件T恤放在火上烧的样子。啊，平静的湖水！小鸟在歌唱！\\n\\n我知道自己不是一个有趣的初次约会对象。我想问问潜在的伴侣们是否以及何时想当父亲——对不起？你没怎么想过这个问题？那个已经长出几根灰发的男人耸了耸肩，这让我觉得他狂妄傲慢。\\n\\n在我看来，他的傲慢有两个主要原因，一个是相信自己的精子质量还能保持很长一段时间，第二个是相信，只要自己愿意，随时可以找一个更年轻的女人。让我分析一下男人们的这两种观念的证据，先说生育能力。\\n\\n你的精子并不是永远都有活力。一项追踪调查了8559个怀孕案例的 一项追踪调查了8559个怀孕案例的 研究 发现，“与30岁以下的男人相比，40岁以上的男人在12个月内让女方怀孕的几率会降低30%。”\\n\\n那项研究是2000年进行的，是少数几个关注男性生育能力的研究之一。你瞧，科学家们花费大量时间敦促女性理解受孕，但只有一小部分研究是关于父亲的年龄。换句话说，所有关于女性在快40岁时努力怀孕的数据，都没有考虑到这个事实：那些女性中有很多是想从40多岁的男人那里受孕。\\n\\n约会网站OkCupid收集的数据显示了对男女性分别最具吸引力的年龄。 Illustration by Mona Chalabi. Source: “Dataclysm” by Christian Rudder\\n\\n我们已经慢慢接受了这种观念：男人像酒，愈久愈醇。而女人像奶酪，会慢慢长出蓝纹，开始发臭。有时候我潜意识里也这么认为。我觉得乔治·克鲁尼(George Clooney)很性感，而贾斯汀·比伯(Justin Bieber)不性感（克鲁尼比我大26岁，而比伯比我小7岁）。\\n\\n我听起来愤怒吗？也许是的，但我并不恐惧。我从浴室里出来查看自己的身体时，可以看到膝盖以上的皮肤变松弛了。我不想在单身和一个膝盖比我还老很多的男人之间做选择。我想，也许我能忍受我爱的人和我以同样的速度老去。\\n\\n所以，我在这里请求其他寻找男性伴侣的单身女性们帮个忙。今天，在这里和我一起许下誓言。不是单身誓言（那有什么乐趣呢？），而承诺寻找同龄恋人，从而永远结束这种折磨。\\n\\n我理解你们的犹豫不决。也许我们都尝试过与更年轻的男性约会，无袖衬衫、没有床单的床以及毫无节制的自私让我们感到痛苦。但是姐妹们！我们必须坚持下去。就算不是为了自己，也要为了彼此而坚持下去。我在此发誓，我不会把合适的更老的男人从约会池中抢走——那样做不仅是向将来的自己扇耳光，而且是暗示同龄男性他们有的是时间。时间太宝贵了，不能赠予别人——所以，请不要把那2.3年拱手让出。',\n",
       " '许多新兴市场的开支超出自身承受能力，并依赖外国贷款机构为这些恣意挥霍的习性提供资金支持，从而导致自己面临金融危机的风险。但土耳其在埃尔多安2002年上台前，就已经是这种情况的一个极端例子。近来，埃尔多安的鲁莽经济政策——包括人为压低利率水平，推高债务、赤字和通胀——只是让事情变得更糟。许多富裕的土耳其人已看到了又一场危机的来临，早在外国人加入到逃离大潮之前就已外逃，加速了土耳其里拉在过去几天里的下跌。\\n\\n土耳其的麻烦是自己制造的，针对土耳其的经济战争是埃尔多安阴谋论的凭空想象。但是，在美元飙升的影响上，他说的有些道理，美元给发展中国家造成伤害的问题由来已久。\\n\\n与土耳其之前的许多新兴市场货币危机一样，这次危机也发生在美联储加息导致美元升值之际。随着美元走强，土耳其这样的发展中国家偿还美元债务的难度加大，最终让投资者开始逃离。\\n\\n现在的问题是，土耳其是否会像1997年的泰铢贬值那样，处于一场更广泛的全球危机的边缘。答案并不清楚。土耳其里拉的贬值已对其他新兴市场的货币产生了负面影响，但这些国家中很少有像土耳其这样，面临着巨额外债和助长通胀的政府政策的双重问题。\\n\\n但是，还有一个更大的问题正在逼近：正在削弱土耳其经济的强势美元，可能也在危害世界第二大经济体中国。\\n\\n中国易受美元走强的影响有不同的原因。在某个层面上，中国对进口的依赖远低于土耳其，土耳其不得不从外国进口几乎所有的原材料，包括石油。而且，中国还有一个与土耳其不同的地方，它没有长期的贸易逆差，不需要靠大量的美元贷款来为本国的海外购买提供资金。\\n\\n但是，在2008年的全球金融危机爆发之后，中国政府曾试图通过命令国有银行发放新贷款来保持经济增长。全球债务在过去十年的增长中，有一半以上是中国境内发放的国内贷款。在中国流通的货币量比在美国流通的多得多，其中大部分掌握在不断寻找更高回报的中国人手里。\\n\\n中国南通，银行职员在清点100元面值的人民币。该国目前流通的货币量已经超过了美国。 Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\n因此，中国也面临着严重的资本外逃风险。上一轮的外逃始于2015年，当时有初步迹象显示，美联储将开始加息。中国通过收紧货币控制阻止了那次外逃，但控制措施很少能长期有效。精明的国人会找到创造性的方式把他们的钱带出去。\\n\\n今年，美联储的紧缩政策进一步推高了美元，而中国政府的宽松货币政策则进一步削弱了人民币，这就加大了中国投资者将人民币换成美元的诱惑。现在，中国人在美国可以挣到同样的利息，风险却低得多，因此他们逃离中国的意愿强烈，而且随着美联储的进一步加息，这种欲望会越来越强。\\n\\n北京也可能试图通过让人民币升值来削弱强势美元的吸引力。但这将意味着收紧人民币的供应。在中国经济增长由于债务负担过重已经放缓时，这样做可能会让经济脱轨。\\n\\n中国还在试图通过让人民币在世界上更受欢迎来挑战美元的霸权地位，但这是一个长期计划，尚未取得成功。尽管美国在全球经济中所占的份额已从2001年的32%下降到23%，但美元仍是世界上遥遥领先的最受欢迎货币，从贷款到进出口贸易的支付都会使用美元。\\n\\n世界各国央行持有的外汇储备中，60%以上是美元，中国让人民币成为储备货币的雄心几乎没人买账。各国的央行和投资者仍对持有人民币持谨慎态度，中共当局可能随时对这个货币加以控制，就像他们在2016年所做的那样。\\n\\n因此，中国正面临一个棘手的问题。不断走强的美元可能会引发更多的资本外流，但任何支撑人民币的做法都可能会进一步减缓中国的经济增长。多年来，中国政府一直靠印更多的人民币来应对经济疲软的迹象，这种做法在美国实行非常宽松的货币政策时有效。现在美国正在提高利率，中国降低利率的做法只会让中国投资者有更多的理由撤资。\\n\\n世界经济的命运取决于中国如何应对这一困境。中国14万亿美元的经济规模是土耳其的15倍以上，约占全球经济体量的16%。\\n\\n这是决定性的。\\n\\n对世界其他国家来说，里拉的崩溃可能转瞬即逝，而中国则有可能决定这场危机的走向。',\n",

       " '中国正在经历一个非同寻常的历史性时刻。\\n\\n“米兔”运动——也就是英文#MeToo（“我也是”）运动的戏谑音译，在中国社交媒体的广泛传播，正在开启一个深刻的私人关系、文化和社会变革契机。虽然这个契机很可能瞬息即逝，但是“米兔”已经造就了一个相对进步的性别议题对话场域，将对父权体系的批判意识引入大众和意见领袖的讨论，将这个批判和观察延展到社会的多个群体和阶层。\\n\\n在这一轮“米兔”运动之前，性侵/骚扰事件受害者及其同情者在网络进行公开控诉，其实一直存在。但引起大规模关注的通常是一些命案或者涉及性侵未成年人的案件，比如2009年湖北女服务员邓玉娇愤而刺杀逼迫其卖淫的官员；2015年一位江苏22岁女孩遭继父10年性侵和骚扰最终自杀，她的控诉遗书被公布在网上，引起网民广泛愤怒声讨。这种案例每年都有几起会引起大众的关注和热议。\\n\\n但在既往性侵命案或者性侵未成年人案后，相关的大规模公共讨论多半以传统的道德义愤表达开始，以法院宣判文书和法制节目谈话里的总结告终；基本没有触及性别权力文化构架。针对其他的性侵案讨论则很少获得大规模关注，针对性骚扰的大规模讨论则更少。就算偶有一两个话题引发关注，得到的更多是嘲讽和误解。比如2016年上海地铁公司官方微博发布微博警告女性不要穿暴露服装招引骚扰后，两位女权运动者身着清凉装，打出“我可以骚，你不能扰”口号进行抗议。当时网络评论里仍可见到很多人表示支持上海地铁公司官博，并批评抗议者“不顾现实”，“误导他人放弃自保技能”。\\n\\n龙泉寺住持学诚法师2014年在北京人民大会堂。他被指控向女弟子发送露骨短信，并向她们做出不受欢迎的性要求。 Wang Zhao/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\n此次“米兔”运动有截然不同于以往性侵或性骚扰事件的公共讨论，它的几个明显新特征，是我20多年的媒体经验和更长的阅读经验里没有见过的。\\n\\n这些广泛的参与，使得很多人非常震惊。因为传统社会文化施加于性受害者（无论男女）的羞辱，而大多数受害者又是女性，她们通常选择对自己的遭遇保持沉默，这就造成了男性和女性、乃至女性和女性之间在这个经验上的巨大隔膜。不少女性在看到“米兔”运动之后，与朋友们进行交流，才发现自己一直以为“都是我倒霉”的个人经历，原来是女性的普遍遭遇。\\n\\n“米兔”引发的第二个新现象，是它获得的关注和支持之广泛和新传播形式的产生。在微信小程序“微信指数”中的搜索结果显示，“性骚扰”一词在7月24日高峰期关注度是3100多万，7月26日第二个高峰期是2500多万。虽然相比之下远低于疫苗事件顶峰时期3亿多关注，但这已经是针对女性遭遇性骚扰话题罕见的关注度。\\n\\n更重要的是，我们看到了大量网民、新一代知识分子、媒体人和其他专业人士，包括很多男性在内，对“米兔”表示出坚定和持续的支持。从社交媒体评论互动到自媒体和传统媒体评论文章，对倾诉者的同情已经是普遍现象。而在“米兔”之前的很多社交媒体讨论，要么得不到太多关注，要么很少见到压倒性同情被骚扰和性侵女性成年人的情况。\\n\\n二十年前自杀的高岩，在中国引发了一场有关性骚扰的讨论。\\n\\n“米兔”开启的第三个先河，是它引发的讨论之深入，早已不再局限于对单个男性的指控，而推进到对整个社会的父权权力架构各个层面的审视，和对运动本身的自我审视和发展思考。正如作家梁鸿在文章《我渴望“米兔”一直走下去》里说到自己在此次大讨论里受到的思想涤荡：“我简直是胆战心惊地看着一篇又一篇文章出来。我感谢有生之年能够经历这样的时刻，能够有这样的机会，感受这场发自民间又蔓延至知识界、法律界和社会各个角落的思想运动。”\\n\\n也部分因为刘瑜文章引发的争论之推动，此次参与讨论的文章和网络对话里，除了讨论性骚扰/侵犯事件本身之外，出现了很多深入探讨父权权力结构对女性（也包括部分年轻男性和LGBT群体）的压迫的讨论。从不同的角度深入探讨的话题很多，这里只举一些例子：为什么大规模性骚扰/侵犯是父权权力结构的必然产物（艾晓明，《支持Me too，就是支持女权反压迫运动》；貌似受益于父权社会的“女利”主义者为什么其实依然是受害者（Kiva，《受害者自省书》）；性骚扰为什么是对女性生存和发展权的挤压和侵害（侯虹斌，《我没有被性骚扰，但我必须为不被性骚扰付出代价》）；“米兔”与20世纪极权组织引导的民众革命或者非法行动之间的区别（孙金昱，《“米兔”中的集体行动正当性、个体责任与诬告》）；“米兔”不仅是对公权力，也是对父权社会惯例、习俗、语言文化、观念、道德、文化的更新，并指向政治、法律、社会等相应建构的改造（Lion，《漩涡边缘的局内人：我在中大人类学系如何反性骚扰》）等等。\\n\\n更多讨论和文章还在不断涌现。\\n\\n这是中国女性和部分有现代意识的男性，第一次在没有任何政治党派组织引领的情况下，如此大规模、自觉自主地以个人身份批判和反抗父权文化和父权权力架构，进行自我赋权。\\n\\n\\n\\n“米兔”的必然性\\n\\n所有这些新现象，只是中国社会在过去20年里大规模变迁的一个折射。“米兔”必然到来，因为这些变迁酝酿了足够的条件。\\n\\n一些知识和思维陈旧的中文世界知识分子和意见领袖，因为个人或者朋友受到“米兔”牵连，或者因为观念被挑战而感到不适，第一反应是以阴谋论来解释这些变化，认为“米兔”中有些人是受到权力机构或个人背后指使的运动，但这只是因为他们对平权运动的缺乏了解或同情，或对社会变迁的无知无觉。\\n\\n在“米兔”运动中，我们看到了一个相对成熟的性别权力议题对话场域的形成。这个场域不同于既往传统媒体或者“原始互联网”的对话场域，没有被传统媒体或者网络媒体编辑及意见领袖主宰（比如“婆媳关系论坛”或者“百家论坛”），有高度的自发性，而没有层级尊卑体系。\\n\\n这个场域的核心聚集了一个群体，他们当中很多人受过高等教育，至少具备性别权力初步意识，其中一小部分还具备相关专业知识，因此具有持续深入关注和参与性别权力议题的能力，不太容易被转移注意力。\\n\\n对“女利主义“和平权运动的区别辨认逐步清晰，对诞生”女利主义“的父权权力构架逐步增强了解，也是这个场域在达成共识过程中的关键知识。虽然这个场域目前的相对封闭，很可能在未来被打破，并可能出现变数，但从这个场域来开始讨论性别权力架构，已经是一个最好的开始。\\n\\n迄今为止，这个对话场域与聚焦娱乐、时政、体育等话题的对话场域体现出了很明显的区别。这些区别的原因有多重，其中之一就是中国社会在80年代之后的财富增长和城市化，伴随着独生子女政策，加上重视孩子教育的传统，使得很多独生女儿（尤其是在城市家庭里）享受到了前所未有的教育资源和家庭关注，成长为独立、自主、有高自尊的新一代女性。这是独生子女政策这棵严酷的树上结出的意外果实。这批受过高等教育、高自尊的80后女性（和部分因此发展出现代意识的男性）是此次“米兔”运动发声的主力。她们所受的教育、经济的独立和持续学习的能力，使她们能够清晰地表达自己的遭遇，提出更高的诉求。\\n\\n另一个主要原因就是中国平权运动推进者多年持续的努力，普及了“米兔”运动的一些关键思想和话语资源。比如中国妇女研究的开创者李小江的妇女研究；比如曾推进中国反家暴立法却被迫解散的反家暴网络组织；中山大学以艾晓明教授为代表的女权运动者及其组织从学术到行动上对女权意识的推进；“妇女传媒监测网络”和“女童组织“等民间组织；还有许多个人行动者和女权知识的网络普及者。\\n\\n因为大多数女性时时要对抗身体受到的威胁，这使她们的自由行动受限（或者至少在想象程度上受限），也使她们被一再弱化和自我弱化，因而不得不放弃很多职业机会。关于性骚扰为什么是对女性生存和发展权的挤压和侵害，侯虹斌在《我没有被性骚扰，但我必须为不被性骚扰付出代价》一文中有相对详细的个案描述：当女性因为反感普遍存在的骚扰文化而退出某些场合，她自然也就失去了很多发展机会，甚至可能失去生存机会。\\n\\n广州的一家家具厂里，一名女工在组装桑拿房的木板组件。 Forbes Conrad for The New York Times\\n\\n可以想象，虽然“米兔”运动引发的大规模倾诉，在现阶段会面临“倾听疲劳”的危险，但这些故事的大规模讲述，首先消除了受害者的羞耻感，部分缓解了她们所受的持久的二次伤害。其次，大规模的讲述奠定了一种原先没有的共识，即父权压迫普遍存在，以及父权之下，女性身体安全普遍缺失的现实，这种讲述对打破经验隔膜、形成行动共识，非常必要。在平权思想和话语的支持下，一代新女性对于身体自主、平等和自尊的真实诉求，是不会轻易消散的。\\n\\n“米兔”的诉求是什么\\n\\n那么，新一代女性的诉求是什么？\\n\\n这个问题正是中国“米兔”面临的最大误解。很多不理解的人会认为，“米兔”是一个许多个体的寻仇运动，是保守女性的守贞运动，或者仅仅是一个反性侵和骚扰的运动。\\n\\n对“米兔”的误解，主要原因在于“米兔”是一个非常特殊的运动：它跨越了所有经济阶层和群体，而直接从最私密的个人经验开始，切入了家庭、职场、公共空间的每一个角落，揭开父权社会的隐秘压迫。\\n\\n“米兔”运动之特殊，正在于它并没有某个具体的敌人或者敌对人群。它始于身体安全的诉求，而最终主张则是文化和性别权力重构。作为一个全新的运动，它只有一个抽象的敌人，就是父权权力架构。这要求运动者推动男性去共建这个新的性别权力构架，而不是要把男性摧毁掉。\\n\\n父权权力架构是一个久远的架构，它渗透于文学、艺术、社会及家庭行为准则、道德、组织规范、法律、政治等各个领域。它也不分国界，剑桥大学古典学教授玛丽·彼尔德(Mary Beard)在近日接受中国学者赵静一采访时，谈及自己的新作《女性与权力》，回顾了古希腊和古罗马女性的低下地位，以及男性写作中巨大的一个文化焦点，即对女性的压迫。在中国，自“民知有母而不知有父”的母系社会终结之后，礼法的逐步树立，也伴随着对女性的压迫和束缚的体系化。\\n\\n在这个体系之中，女性被物化，被缩减为生育机器和男性及家族的服务者，任何此外的潜能发挥和自由主张，都会被视为对社会秩序的威胁。虽然经过20世纪的革命运动，中国女性已经通过自身努力大大拓展了自由的边界，但千年文学传统为之赋予的审美传统，和隐藏在司法、行政和政治体系中的父权理念和规则，依然在约束压迫着女性。\\n\\n而早已平等分担经济重任的女性，已经受够了在忍受不安全的环境时，还要忍受“不要太过性感”“不要不懂表现性感”“不要过于强硬”“不要软弱不懂愤起反击”“不要依赖男人”“不要太讲独立”之类混乱、独断而相互矛盾的日常训诫。\\n\\n正因如此，在夺回女性身体的自主权和主宰身体的话语权的同时，“米兔”的支持者还应该逐步推进对传统文学艺术的解剖，对当代文学艺术、社会及家庭行为准则、道德、组织规范、法律、政治之中父权对女性（以及其他边缘群体）的压迫之批判。这个批判与唯阶级论的左派理论批判不同，它对“权力”的定义超越了公共领域的范畴，进入了家庭和个人关系的私域，所要求的平等也更为全面。\\n\\n当然，和一切理想主义驱动的运动一样，在一个不容权力协商的体制里，“米兔”也是脆弱的。它很可能因为其改良之声得不到呼应乃至被打压，而产生出极端化的声音。然而，虽然在法律制定、法律执行、组织权力协商等“坚硬”的堡垒里，良性构建非常难以实现，但“米兔”的支持者们，目前依然可以在文化、社会关系和家庭教育领域推进现代平权意识。从这一轮“米兔”运动引起的共鸣来看，这样的推进完全可能产生更普遍的果实。而这些看似更“软性”的领域里的“米兔”变革，将为中国社会的现代化打下更深远的基础。',\n",
       " '日本奈良——我们刚在沿大同江的一艘大游艇上吃完了一顿漫长的、以喝为主的晚宴，这里位于朝鲜的对外窗口——首都平壤市中心。两名女服务员不再跟着我们的英语导游尼克一起唱着喧闹的卡拉OK。现在，在我们回酒店的大巴上，一位年轻的导游突然充满感情地唱起了《丹尼男孩》(Danny Boy)。他迷人、优雅的同事彭小姐——朝鲜很擅长给来访者留下深刻的印象——在谈论作为一名26岁的未婚女性所面临的压力，香奈儿(Chanel)的发夹在她的头上闪闪发亮。我们的另一名看守——四五个人看着我们这14个人，用摄像机记录着我们的一举一动，他们说这是在录“旅游纪念视频”——不停地说，“你们认为我是政府间谍。对吧？”\\n\\n但再次来到朝鲜是因为，这里格外能促使我去思考一些有关人何为人的尖锐问题。这里格外能动摇我对“现实”本质做出的那些方便的假设。我周围的人显然跟我一样，会难过、会流血、会发怒；但如果告诉你，你在家里放的如果不是国父像，而是你母亲或者孙女的照片，是会坐牢甚至可能判死刑的，这对你的本能会构成什么影响？不能离开家乡，不能说出自己的想法，真是身为人的一部分吗？我从来不怀疑人性是一种特权，尽管我们作为会思考的动物，同时也是一群煽动、密谋和幻想的造物。政府总是想对此进行压制，生活在更自由世界中的一些人，选择与屏幕为伴或者通过屏幕来看世界的方式，将自己囚禁起来，就像佛教煽动者阿欣维拉杜(Ashin Wirathu)，无视佛陀辛辛苦苦阐明的共同人性，将他的穆斯林邻居比作豺狼。如今，越来越多的人似乎在以机器决定的后人类速度生活着，以至于我们几乎没有时间陪伴孩子与朋友。但如果我们感到人性失格——或者假装我们可以用工程手段消除死亡——对我们大多数人来说，这是我们的一个选择，并且可以随时反悔。\\n\\n在我生活了30多年的日本，没人会为了要不要跟机器人结婚，或者因为把铅笔扔到房间另一头而要不要跟它道歉这种事情纠结。我们的邻居们兴高采烈地谈论着“2.5次元”和“亚人”，他们的政府已经任命没有嘴巴的可爱卡通形象Hello Kitty和一只22世纪的蓝色机器猫哆啦A梦任命为文化大使。在一个万物有灵论的神道教宇宙中，有生命和无生命之间的界限是不同的——你在宫崎骏那些美丽的电影看到了，每一片叶子和每一粒尘埃都被认为是有灵魂的。在日本，就像它的邻国朝鲜一样，个体通常被视为一个单位的一部分，是一群声音中的一个；她的工作也许是看不见的、听不见的，与周遭的众人没有分别。在东京一家名为“家庭浪漫”(Family Romance)的公司，1200名演员随时准备收费扮演一个角色几年，可以是孩子生活中缺失的父亲，或者一个妻子的婚外情人。长崎的海茵娜酒店(Henn-na Hotel)称自己是世界上“首个机器人酒店”。\\n\\n但所有这一切只意味着人类体会情感的界限被拉伸，甚至包括花粉的微粒，或是载着人们的铁路车厢。在日本，即使死者也被视为人类。我的岳母在二月去世后，她最亲近的亲戚一直在与她聊天，在她的棺材边放一杯她最喜欢的啤酒，在她蜡黄的脸上涂上腮红。她父亲被埋葬五年后，我的妻子仍然会为他送上食物；这个月我们的儿子将回家，因为他故去的外祖父母被认为也要回家访问三天。\\n\\n对我来说，这只能证实我们许多人内心的感觉：神性和人性的关系可能比我们想象的更紧密。我和达赖喇嘛对话了44年，每当他强调自己也是凡夫俗子：有时会不耐烦，有时会悲伤，就像我们其他人一样，我都会觉得感动。我一直重读格雷厄姆·格林(Graham Greene)的小说，因为他提醒我们，一个“威士忌牧师”可以喝醉，忽视所有职责，甚至生下孩子，但他的善良和无私依然足以令道貌岸然的红衣主教感到羡慕。格林知道，我们的真正的力量蕴藏在我们的脆弱之中（就算只是因为我们同情他人的能力也蕴藏在脆弱里）。\\n\\n30多年来，我一直在旅行——到也门、到复活节岛、到埃塞俄比亚——去看看各种习俗、环境和种族差异之下的人性可能是怎样的。我看到躲避子弹的年轻母亲，看到生活在垃圾堆里的孩子，看到那些疾病令他们失去与人类相关的大部分能力与定义的人。然而，如果环境有所改变，我从不怀疑几乎每一个人的人性都可以得到恢复。\\n\\n我第一次访问朝鲜，是在驳船上那个傍晚的24年前，在那座城市里的最后一个下午，向导带着我上了一座山。那里只有我们两人。山下是最先进的摩天大楼（虽然往往无人居住），还有游乐园和整洁、宽阔的林荫大道，这一切都是他的政府建造的，那里35年前还是废墟，朝鲜人说，当时，在那座被毁弃的城市，只剩下两座建筑没有倒下。\\n\\n我的向导并不是不谙世事的；他在巴基斯坦学习了三年，会说乌尔都语和英语。他知道他心目中的所谓“过着人的生活”，与我的想法非常不同。但他说，“不要听我的宣传。只需告诉你在美国的朋友你在这里看到了什么。”\\n\\n这个时刻，他是不是脱离了剧本——或者只是他的导演给了他的一套更狡猾的台词？我说不好。但我可以感觉到他打动了我内心的某种人性，以及两个人类之间可以分享的任何理解，即使他们来自截然不同的的世界。在我看来，官方的平壤似乎绝对称不上人性，但是当我通过离境处时，我的向导一直在向我挥手告别，我感受到一种新鲜的力量，没有人可以完全剥夺我们的人性，除了我们自己。',\n",

       " '加州欧文——乔治·李在中国社会长大，他觉得那里没有给人公平的对待。毛泽东政府认为他的家庭是走资派，监禁了他的父亲。\\n\\n因此，当乔治·李1999年搬到加州时，他觉得他已经找到了他的美国梦。他努力工作并获得了回报：一个硕士学位，然后一份让他与妻子及两个孩子能过上舒适生活的工作。\\n\\n但在四年前，当一名同事告诉他，一项州措施将允许加州公立大学在招生中采用平权政策时，他开始警觉。由于担心这会损害他的孩子受教育的机会，乔治·李平生第一次在政治上变得活跃了起来。\\n\\n他签署了一份请愿书，并向一项旨在停止平权行动措施的运动捐款。他加紧办理入籍事宜，以便能够投票。他参与了支持州议会选举共和党候选人的竞选活动。最近，他领导了一个名为金橙俱乐部(Orange Club)的当地美籍华人政治行动委员会，该俱乐部现在致力于在中期选举中支持加州的共和党候选人。\\n\\n“我们刚刚意识到，如果我们不参与这个进程，美国的政治进程，我们就会被遗忘，”乔治·李说。\\n\\n49岁的乔治·李是越来越多曾对政治无动于衷，但却因基于种族的学校招生问题引发的斗争而受到激发的华裔美国人之一。\\n\\n从欧文、休斯顿到华盛顿郊区，像金橙俱乐部这样的华人活动团体开始吸引立法者的注意并影响政策辩论。它们的大部分政治活动可以在中国社交媒体平台微信上找到，活动人士在微信上分享文章并传播信息。对于任何寻求支持的政界人士来说，它们都有一个明确的试金石：反对平权行动。\\n\\n皇后学院(Queens College)教授安德鲁·贝弗里奇(Andrew Beveridge)表示，根据人口普查数据，与在中国出生的移民总人数相比，他们的人数很少。近几十年来，中国出生的移民人数激增，从1980年的47.2万人增加到了2016年的280多万人。\\n\\n但是最近一些关于教育的斗争凸显了他们日益增长的政治影响力。几十个美籍华人组织在2015年帮助起草了一份提交司法部的申诉，指控哈佛大学在招生中歧视亚裔美国人。几周前，当纽约市长白思豪(Bill de Blasio)提议改变该市特殊高中的招生标准时，他们站在了抗议的前线，在那些学校的学生中，亚裔美国人占一半以上。\\n\\n这些活动人士已经取得了胜利。在加州，他们帮助击败了平权行动措施，即《第五号加州宪法修正案》(S.C.A. 5.)。在纽约，布鲁克林区行政长官埃里克·亚当斯(Eric Adams)最初支持白思豪的计划，但在遭到华裔大举抗议之后，他放弃了。\\n\\n关于教育中种族问题的争论集中在学校应该在多大程度上努力控制它们学生的种族构成。在许多精英大学和特殊高中，黑人和西语裔学生的比例偏低，而亚裔和白人学生的比例相对于他们的总人口来说偏高。\\n\\n像乔治·李这样的活动人士担心，如果学校按照种族来调整学生比例，亚裔学生的利益会受损。\\n\\n金橙俱乐部由奥兰治县(Orange County)的一群华裔母亲创办，她们帮助新来的移民适应学校系统和当地社区。俱乐部的发起者之一莎拉·杨说，当2014年平权行动措施出台时，该组织中的几位家长开始询问他们能做些什么来阻止这种情况。\\n\\n莎拉·杨有一个19岁的儿子，他将进入芝加哥大学读大二，她还有一个16岁的女儿，正在读高中11年级。\\n\\n虽然芝加哥大学是她儿子的首选之一，但莎拉·杨说，还有其他几个精英学校没有录取他。\\n\\n莎拉·杨是金橙俱乐部的创始人之一。“我们都明白，与其他种族相比，为了进入大学，亚洲孩子必须在各方面做得更好，”她说。 Rozette Rago for The New York Times\\n\\n“没有人确切知道什么在录取决策中发挥了作用，”她说。“但我认为总的来说，种族是等式的一部分。有多重要，我们不知道。我们都明白，与其他种族相比，为了进入大学，亚洲孩子必须在各方面做得更好。”\\n\\n莎拉·说，她的女儿意识到她作为亚裔美国人进入精英大学所面对的高标准，她给了自己额外的压力。\\n\\n“这在某种程度上是不公平的，”她说。“为了进入他们梦想中的学校，他们必须非常非常努力。”\\n\\n莎拉·说她对种族斗争很熟悉。她克服许多挑战，才成为了一家由白人男性主导的科技公司的工程副总裁。她说，学校应该是一个伟大的、创造公平的地方，一个你的种族或性别不应该给你任何优势的地方。\\n\\n但她说，平权法案彻底颠覆了这个观念。关于第五号加州宪法修正案，她表示，“我没想到美国能有这么不公平的法案。”\\n\\n为了抗争，萨拉·杨和奥兰治县的其他华裔美国人开会、发传单、在网上签名请愿。他们到州众议员周本立(Ed Chau)的办公室前举行抗议，他最终与民主党同僚决裂，并出来公开反对该法案。\\n\\n2014年底，这个团体与四名反对平权行动的共和党州立法机构候选人举行了会面，并对他们表示支持。它招募了数十名志愿者，为他们助选。这四名非现任议员的候选人，都赢得了选举。\\n\\n“他们经常出现的我的竞选办公室，”共和党人金映玉(Young Kim)说。她取代了现任的民主党州众议院女议员，目前正在竞选国会席位。“这是我第一次知道，有非常活跃的华裔美国父母在组织这场运动，特别是为了奋力抵抗第五号加州宪法修正案。”\\n\\n即使在加利福尼亚赢得斗争之后，乔治·李和其他活动人士仍然保持着警惕。他表示，重要的是，要防止民主党在加州的立法机构获得绝大多数席位，这可能会让他们得以通过恢复平权行动的法案。他说，他13岁的儿子尽管学习成绩优异，但还是担心他的前途。\\n\\n“我认为，如果现行的大学招生政策和做法不改变的话，对他来说将会非常非常艰难，”他说。“作为亚洲男性，进入顶尖的精英学校将会非常难。”\\n\\n乔治·李的女儿在加州大学伯克利分校(University of California, Berkeley)攻读环境研究，即将念大四。他表示，如果平权行动重回加州，她恐怕是进不了这所大学的。\\n\\n对于许多中国家庭来说，对教育的重视深深植根于他们的传统。\\n\\n在1000多年的时间里，科举制度一直是中国主要的统治方式，它导致了一个官僚士绅阶层的崛起，取代了继承特权的贵族。这个考试是社会流动性的强大引擎。随着清朝推翻，科举制度于1911年废除。\\n\\n后来，在毛泽东的领导下，以及文革动乱期间，学校停课。1976年文革结束后，它们才恢复招生，这个国家对教育的渴望显而易见，在接下来的两年时间里，有超过1100万的考生参加了高考。\\n\\n2016年的大选中，大多投票给希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)的华裔美国人在是否支持平权法案的问题上存在分歧。根据全美亚裔调查(National Asian-American Survey)的数据，他们对该政策的支持率下降，从2012年的78%降至2016年的41%。在同一时期的其他亚裔当中，支持平权行动的比例保持不变，接近四分之三。\\n\\n旧金山进步华人协会(Chinese Progressive Association)会长亚历克斯·T·汤姆(Alex T. Tom)说，他支持平权行动，因为他相信，亚裔跟其他人一样，也能受益于在多元化的环境中学习。\\n\\n汤姆今年42岁，父亲是中国人，母亲是台湾人，他说他没有进入自己优先选择的两所大学——加州大学伯克利分校(University of California, Berkeley)和加州大学洛杉矶分校(University of California, Los Angeles)。但他上了加州大学圣地亚哥分校(University of California, San Diego)，他说，在那里，他接触了种族多元化社区。\\n\\n“生活在多元化的社会中是有好处的，”他说。“我有一个黑人室友，还有拉丁美洲和白人室友，他们都让我获益匪浅。”\\n\\n他说，一些中国移民可能认为他们可以通过获得精英机构的学位来克服潜在歧视，但他们仍然会面临种族主义。\\n\\n“无论如何，你仍然像是这个国家的异类，”他说。\\n\\n平权行动的一个论点是，它有助于纠正几代人都面临系统性种族主义的非裔美国人所受的伤害。\\n\\n但其他许多华裔活动人士表示，他们认为，以种族为基础的录取是美国为数不多的、代表着真正歧视的事物之一。硅谷华人协会成员托尼·许(Tony Xu)表示，他对其他种族主义指控就没那么确定了。\\n\\n“在人们头脑里，也许还有一些东西依然存在，”他说。“没有什么系统性的歧视。我不相信；我没有感觉到。”\\n\\n相反，活动人士说，他们所经历的琐事——无论是他人嘲弄他们的口音还是嘲笑他们眼睛的形状——仅限于个人互动。\\n\\n“我们从未觉得这是整个社会所做的事，”莎拉·杨说。“你会觉得这只是个人行为。我们并不真正觉得是体制在制造这种歧视。”\\n\\n一些活动人士的政治工作还导致他们面临其他问题。在马里兰州，一个中国激进组织提出抗议后，2017年提出的一项城市庇护措施没有获得通过。该法律如实施，将禁止使用州和地方资金来帮助联邦移民执法。反对该措施的华裔美国人说，既然他们遵守了这个国家的移民法，耐心等待获得公民身份，其他人也应该这样做。\\n\\n金橙俱乐部现在专注于帮助共和党人在今年秋季的中期选举中获胜。奥兰治县有很多竞争激烈的众议院席位角逐，该俱乐部还支持共和党候选人约翰·考克斯(John Cox)竞选加州州长。\\n\\n今年6月，金橙俱乐部页面上的一篇文章呼吁志愿者在共和党和前州参议员鲍勃·赫夫(Bob Huff)的国会初选活动的最后几天提供帮助。文章说，如果拥趸们可以提供帮助，请将自己的名字填写到帖子中。共有28人报名参加，竞选最后失败了。\\n\\n“我们不要忘记，2014年，鲍勃·赫夫在加州参议院独自与第五号加州宪法修正案作斗争，”文章说，现在是时候“以实际行动报答他。上帝助自助者。帮助鲍勃·赫夫就是帮助我们华人。”',\n",
       " '北京——美国和中国一直在贸易问题上争吵不休，针锋相对的冲突几乎没有缓和的迹象。高层会谈已陷入停顿，双方都在过去一周里威胁要进一步加征关税。\\n\\n但据参与贸易谈判的人士及其顾问们说，在唇枪舌剑的背后，两条潜在的出路似乎正出现在中国面前。这两种选择都将为特朗普总统及其偏温和的顾问们带来贸易上的胜利，同时也能让中国国家主席习近平继续推进其雄心勃勃的产业计划，在尖端技术领域打造世界领先的国家企业。\\n\\n打一个平手似乎是最有可能的结局，这将让美国和中国的新关税维持数月甚至数年的时间。到目前为止，美国已对价值340亿美元的中国技术产品和30亿美元的中国钢铝产品征收了关税，另外还有160亿美元的产品即将开征。特朗普今年夏天甚至还提出了对中国出口美国的所有商品征收关税的可能性。\\n\\n中国目前的立场是，解决贸易紧张关系不应阻碍其进一步的经济发展，但可以对《中国制造2025》做出调整。周三公布的最新贸易数据显示，中国的出口继续增长，这给北京方面带来了一些信心。“红线是中国的发展权，而不是有关《中国制造2025》的具体产业政策和措施，”前商务部官员、至今仍为中国重要的贸易专家之一的何伟文说。\\n\\n对特朗普及其助手来说，中国是头号贸易敌人。为了陈明依据，他们指出两国之间持续存在着巨额贸易赤字，中国国有银行在高技术和先进制造行业为可能与美国巨头竞争的对手提供资金。他们还担心，中国正在加快推进军事建设，这将让北京在亚洲和世界各地有更大的影响力。\\n\\n加征关税解决了特朗普总统的部分担忧，关税的主要作用是减少美国公司对中国供应商的依赖。\\n\\n据几位参与此类决策的人士透露，数百家西方企业已经在重新考虑中国在其供应链中的角色。企业高管们正在越来越多地想办法把产品的最终组装转移到中国以外的地方，主要是亚洲其它地区或墨西哥等低工资国家的工厂。\\n\\n在中国以外进行最后的组装将让公司绕开美国的新设关税。这样做还可能让美国的对华贸易逆差在未来几年开始下降。\\n\\n今年在大连，中国第一艘国产航空母舰。习近平主席正在推进他雄心勃勃的工业计划，扶植尖端科技领域的民族企业巨头。 Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\n但这些做法可能不会对美国的总体贸易逆差带来太大的影响，只是重新分配为与其他国家的贸易逆差而已。企业只是在把生产计划的最后一步转移到印度尼西亚和台湾等地，而不是带回美国，因为美国的蓝领劳动力成本太高。中国也将保持很大的影响力，因为包括电线、螺丝钉、电动马达和数控设备等一长串零部件的制造有很大可能将继续留在中国。\\n\\n“他们并没有打算将供应链搬出中国，”中山世达首席执行官戴维·亨特(David Hunter)说。“他们是在考虑在哪里做最后的改装。”\\n\\n贸易数据咨询公司磐聚网(Panjiva)的一项分析显示，在第二季度的电话会议上，有192家欧美公司提到了关税问题，其中有17%表示已经开始改变供应商，还有约14%表示已经开始转移自己的业务。\\n\\n特朗普政府承担得起坚持下去的后果。美国的经济一直很强劲。而且，新的减税措施足以抵消美国公司所面临的关税。\\n\\n如果关税继续加征下去的话，华盛顿可能会发现其他的麻烦。一些中国问题专家担心，美国政府的贸易立场可能会激怒中国的政策制定者，让他们在其他问题上采取更为对抗的态度。\\n\\n这些专家指出，习近平已把化解贸易战的任务交给了一个相对温和、受过西方教育的官员团队。如果不能达成协议，就可能会削弱温和派，进一步助长强硬派的气焰，推动中国继续展开全方位的军备，采取愈发严厉的国内安全措施。\\n\\n“我们真的需要找到一个接受中国的方法，鼓励这里的温和声音，”北京的律师吉莫曼(James Zimmerman)说，他曾担任中国美国商会(American Chamber of Commerce in China)主席。\\n\\n尽管中国不愿走得这么远，但它可能会做出一些或许能带来表面胜利的让步。\\n\\n中国大庆的一家沃尔沃工厂。随着工业计划的实施，中国正试图提高自己在制造业价值链中的位置。 Reuters\\n\\n中国已表示愿意改变其产业政策中违反全球贸易规则的部分。但中国的计划中也有一些灰色地带。\\n\\n虽然世界贸易组织有许多不允许政府直接补贴企业的规则，但对国有银行系统是否能提供优惠贷款的规则却不太明确。这类贷款多年来一直是中国产业政策的核心，也将继续是《中国制造2025》的核心。\\n\\n中国已开始在《中国制造2025》的框架下探索为更多的研发提供资金的方式，而不是为马上建设大批工厂提供资金。世界贸易组织的规则允许补贴科研。\\n\\n目前的两难问题是，对《中国制造2025》的这些微调是否会有多大作用，是否能安抚特朗普政府。\\n\\n中国可能还在发出愿意在关税问题上妥协的信号。这次贸易战到目前为止，中国政府的报复性措施所涉及的美国产品价值，与华盛顿加征关税的中国产品价值大致相等。美国和中国将很快会对大约500亿美元的商品互征关税。对美国来说，这略低于美国从中国进口总额的十分之一。对中国来说，这大约是中国从美国进口总额的三分之一。\\n\\n中国上周改变了策略。面对美国要对中国出口美国商品的五分之二（或每年2000亿美元的商品）加征关税的威胁，中国政府做出的回应是，威胁对美国对华出口商品的五分之二（也就是每年600亿美元的商品）加征关税。这一变化引发了一个问题：中国是否可能愿意在关税上接受一个折衷的做法，即把加征关税的商品值与单方向贸易总额的等比例挂钩。\\n\\n中国尚未提出任何这类提议。北京最近的做法，虽然有意制造了和解信号，但也属不得已：中国每年从美国进口的商品根本达不到2000亿美元。\\n\\n“这还不是彻底改变局面的一步，”北京咨询公司策伟(Trivium)的联合创始人安德鲁·波尔克(Andrew Polk)在谈到此次贸易纠纷时说。“就目前而言，贸易战可能要持续一段时间，两国的经济都能应付一段时间，而不至于有太大的影响。”',\n",
       " '去年秋天，一位朋友给我讲了个故事，说的是住在纽约西村的著名音乐人、作曲家坂本龙一。坂本看来是非常喜欢默里山一带的某家日本餐馆，频频光顾，乃至终于要跟主厨摊牌：他受不了餐馆给顾客放的音乐。\\n\\n问题不是音乐太吵，而是没放过心思。坂本提议说他可以来帮他们选音乐，不要报酬，只为他在这里吃饭时能舒心些。主厨同意了，于是坂本动手为餐馆做曲目表，完全没有用他自己的音乐。这件事很少有人知道，因为坂本没想刻意张扬。\\n\\n过了几个星期我才意识到这个故事有多厉害，要是确有其事的话。我认为餐馆里播放的无脑音乐是多年来愈发严重的问题，哪怕是流媒体音乐服务到来之后——我们本来还以为那会改善这个情况。\\n\\n要是花一笔可观的钱去吃顿饭，我可不希望是订位员、洗碗工或者什么后勤办公室的人来做这顿饭；我想要烹饪高手。对餐厅里的音乐应该也一样，毕竟饭前饭中饭后都一直在放着。\\n\\n我希望餐厅的音乐不是被当作陪衬，也不是算法算出来的。我希望挑选音乐的人全面了解音乐：了解播放的环境，了解音乐的起伏，了解它在历史和听觉上的俗套。这样的人至少能做到起码的事：用大方、独特、明确而又谦逊的方式告诉顾客，这里的音乐是花了心思的。\\n\\n今年二月，我带着小儿子去了坂本最喜欢的这家餐馆，在39街靠近列克星敦大道。餐馆分楼层经营：二楼的餐厅叫“嘉日”(Kajitsu)，主营“精进料理”的禅意素食，一楼叫Kokage，偏家常的菜式，在同样的料理概念中加入了肉和鱼。（一楼朝向街面的一片柜台辟为日本茶铺“一保堂”[Ippodo]。）\\n\\n一落座，音乐就吸引了我们的注意。音源很朴素——一只单独的宽体扬声器，放在离地一英尺的架子上，藏在一张餐桌后边。（我们在一楼的Kokage，但楼上的“嘉日”也在播放同样的音乐。）我问一个服务员，这是不是坂本先生做的曲目。她说是。\\n\\nKokage和楼上的嘉日都会播放坂本龙一的音乐。 Nathan Bajar for The New York Times\\n\\n66岁的坂本龙一是音乐界的楷模，或许不仅因为他的音乐作品，也因为他的聆听，以及他对如何运用和分享音乐的理解。他是对世界音乐充满好奇的传奇人物，很早就激进地接纳技术，他还是一个超级合作者。从1970年代末与人合创电子流行乐三人组合“黄色魔术交响乐团”(Yellow Magic Orchestra)至今，他已为舞厅、音乐厅、影院、电子游戏、手机铃声、环保行动或政治抵抗行动作过曲或制作过音乐。（最近上映的斯蒂芬·野村·席博[Stephen Nomura Schible]讲述坂本的纪录片《终曲》[CODA]里，这些已大多讲得很详尽。）\\n\\n我们在Kokage听到的一些曲目，显然是坂本会感兴趣的那种。有一些舒缓或空灵的钢琴独奏，隐约源自某些传统音乐；有些旋律可能做过电影配乐主题；还有少量即兴音乐。有演唱的地方，通常不是英文的。有一曲我听出来是出自韦恩·肖特(Wayne Shorter)的唱片《土著舞者》(Native Dancer)，合奏的有弥尔顿·纳西门托(Milton Nascimento)，还有一位听起来像玛丽·卢·威廉姆斯(Mary Lou Williams)的钢琴家，但我拿不准。这些都不是那种可以塑造品牌形象的音乐，也不是那种让你想花钱的；这些曲目代表了一位忠实顾客的渊博知识、敏感与独特。总的来说，我感到不知该说些什么，但感官上得到了关照。我觉得心醉神迷。\\n\\n当他对公共空间的音乐有意见时，他没有投诉的习惯，因为这种事情太常见了。\\n\\n后来我知道坂本还邀请了纽约的音乐制作人、经理人兼策划人高桥龙(Ryu Takahashi)来帮他制作曲目表。我和儿子见到了他们两人，还有坂本的妻子兼经纪人空里香(Norika Sora)，那是个明媚春日的午后，在“嘉日”的营业间隙，餐厅里弥漫着焙番茶的烟草和泥土气味。坂本穿一身黑色，连运动鞋也是。\\n\\n我问坂本，我听说的那个故事是不是真的。他说是。我又问要是这事广为人知，会不会有些烦人。“没关系的，”他说。“也没必要隐瞒。”\\n\\n在公共空间遇到有问题的音乐，他并没有抱怨的习惯，因为这太常见了。“通常就是一走了之，”他说。“我忍受不了。但这家餐馆我是真的喜欢，我敬重他们的主厨大堂。”（大堂浩树[Hiroki Odo]是“嘉日”的第三任主厨，到今年三月已在此工作五年。大堂告诉我说，以前的音乐是餐馆在日本的管理层选的。）\\n\\n“我发现他们的BGM太差，太差了，”坂本说，他用了BGM这个行内叫法来表示背景音乐。（“BGM”也是“黄色魔术交响乐团”1981年出的一张专辑唱片的名字。）他牙缝间倒吸着气。“真的很差啊。”是什么样呢？“糟糕的巴西流行乐和一些美国老民谣混在一起，”他说，“还有些爵士乐，比如迈尔斯·戴维斯(Miles Davis)。”\\n\\n我说这些音乐有的要是单独听，可能是很好的。\\n\\n绽放的樱花。 Nathan Bajar for The New York Times\\n\\n“要是气氛对，有可能，”他答道。“但至少那些巴西流行乐太难听了。我了解巴西音乐。我和巴西人合作过很多次。但那些巴西流行乐太差。有一天下午我根本待不下去。我就走人了。”\\n\\n坂本回家后给大堂浩树写了一封邮件。“我喜欢你做的菜，我尊重你，我喜欢这家餐馆，但我讨厌餐馆的音乐，”他记得他这样写道。“谁选的音乐？把这个糟糕的集合混在一起是谁的决定？让我来做这个吧。因为你做的菜之好可以与桂离宫媲美。”（他指的是京都有千年历史的皇家别墅，在一定程度上是依据所谓“侘寂”的美学原则建造的，这种美学原则追求的是不完美的、自然的环境。）“但你餐馆的音乐却像特朗普大厦(Trump Tower)。”\\n\\n在如今的餐厅，糟糕的音乐体验也许只是在模仿一种有考虑的、至少是充分的——还不错的——体验。这些选择可能是来自一个Pandora或Spotify电台的算法程序的结果，可能来自这些流媒体服务根据大众口味人工编制的众多播放列表。也可能是餐馆里某个工作人员的保险选择，或只考虑自己的选择。餐馆里的食物与餐馆里的音乐一样：只是不错还远远不够。\\n\\n有点提升或超越感必不可少。\\n\\n嘉日的精美细节：一盏茶。 Nathan Bajar for The New York Times\\n\\n他提出理由说，知名的曲目可能有用。但是，有点提升或超越感必不可少。（他提到爱丽丝·柯川[Alice Coltrane]和多萝西·阿什比[Dorothy Ashby]的爵士竖琴音乐，认为那是不会错的音乐的例子。）而且，为你的客户做好的歌单，和你自己听的音乐不是一回事。具体来说，“我在家里可能会听的一些东西，可能感觉暗淡的、反乌托邦的，我是不会碰的。”\\n\\n位于东村的 Superiority Burger 的主厨布鲁克斯·黑德利(Brooks Headley) 自己就是一名音乐人，他从1990年代初开始一直在朋克乐队当鼓手，他把一个iPod交给了一些有识别力的朋友，让他们把建议的音乐添加上去。他提醒他们“不要太情绪化或太严肃的。”他们认真地按照他的要求去做了，他不见得知道正在放的是什么音乐，这是他乐见的。（他的餐馆有一次大获成功的尝试：全专辑播放《与胖子多米诺一起摇滚》[Rock and Rollin’ With Fats Domino]，共29分钟。)\\n\\n我问坂本，制作餐馆歌单是否像挑选自己喜欢的音乐那样简单。“不是，”他说。“刚开始的时候，我曾想做一个氛围音乐集——不是布莱恩·伊诺(Brian Eno)，而是更近期的。”他来到餐馆，边吃边仔细地听。他和妻子一致认为那些音乐太阴暗了。\\n\\n“这里的灯光很亮，”空里香说。“墙壁的颜色，家具的质地，房间的环境，都不适合在欣赏深沉音乐中结束你的夜晚。我觉得，这不只是取决于吃的东西，或一天的时段，还取决于氛围、颜色和装饰。”\\n\\n高桥估计他和坂本至少改过五次，才确定了现在的嘉日版歌单。有些歌曲太这个、或太那个——太大声，太亮，太“爵士”。\\n\\n坂本反对大声的餐厅音乐\\n\\n而且都不是很大声，这可能是年长一些的顾客会更关心的问题。坂本不喜欢餐馆的音乐太响，他经常用手机上的一个测量分贝的应用软件来测量周围的音量。\\n\\n他说，他以前曾为公共场所写过原创音乐，比如为东京的一家科学博物馆和一家广告公司大楼。他使用测量光和风的传感器来改变一天中播放的音乐。但是说到给别人制作歌单，他此前唯一的经历是给自己的家人制作。\\n\\n在儿子学习弹奏贝斯时，他曾为儿子做过一个。出于个人喜好，坂本刻意没有把贝司手杰可·帕斯透瑞斯(Jaco Pastorius)演奏的曲子选进来，但儿子在一周后发现了帕斯透瑞斯，并对父亲不选他的曲子很不满。坂本在父亲生病住院期间给父亲做过一个。他还为母亲的葬礼做过一个。\\n\\n我问他，那是汇集了母亲生前喜欢的音乐吗？坂本停顿了一下，笑了笑，摇着头说，“那算是我的自我主张吧。”\\n\\n坂本和高桥打算在每一季更换一个歌单。大堂浩树的下一个项目、一家名为Hall的酒吧和名为“大堂”的餐厅，计划于今年秋天在曼哈顿熨斗区开业。坂本已经被聘为首席歌单师。',\n",
       " '数十年来，许多开发商和建筑师都努力确保他们的建筑是对这个星球友好的。如今，他们将重心放在了建筑对在其中工作的人的影响上。\\n\\n迪洛斯的新总部位于曼哈顿一幢十层大楼的四层和五层，由晋思建筑师事务所(Gensler)设计。这个占地1.9万平方英尺（约合1765平方米）的办公空间能容纳70名员工，是Well建筑标准的样板间。\\n\\n近期的一个下午，对这个办公室的参观从接待处开始，空气感觉清新。这是有证据的：一个占满一面墙，约6.5英尺（约合2米）高、12英尺宽（约合3.7米）的电子屏幕显示着室内温度、湿度及其他洁净及舒适度的测定数值，这些数据由办公室各处放置的感应器提供。\\n\\n“我们装了51个感应器，非常多，”带领我们参观的迪洛斯主管詹娜·旺兹拉克(Janna Wandzilak)说。\\n\\n经过三层过滤的空气呼呼地从地板上的通风口喷出，与此同时，天花板上的通风管道将充满二氧化碳的空气吸走。爬满墙壁和隔墙的植物也有助于清洁空气，同时还能满足我们与生俱来的与大自然亲近的需求，这就是所谓的“热爱生命的天性”。\\n\\n迪洛斯办公室的实验室。 Cole Wilson for The New York Times\\n\\n站立式办公桌随处可见，一个宽敞的橡木楼梯连接上下两层楼，鼓励员工上下走动，而不是乘坐电梯——这些都有助于健身。\\n\\n“我发现自己确实坐的时候变少了，”迪洛斯的首席执行官保罗·夏拉(Paul Scialla)在自己的办公室接受采访时说，这里到处都是用相框镶嵌起来的照片。其中一张是他与健康专家狄巴克·乔布拉(Deepak Chopra)的合影，后者也是迪洛斯咨询委员会的成员。\\n\\n在华尔街从事债券交易18年后，夏拉于2014年创办了这家公司，在房地产和蓬勃发展的健康运动交叉地带，他发现了一个尚未开发的市场。\\n\\nWell标准体系分为七大类标准，它们旨在提升一幢大楼内人员的健康，包括营养——这解释了迪洛斯咖啡馆中的杏仁酱、全麦面包及有机苹果。其他几大类分别为空气、舒适度、健身、光、精神和水。\\n\\n一个282页篇幅的册子解释了这些由 国际WELL建筑研究院 (International Well Building Institute)管理的标准，这家研究院是迪洛斯衍生出来的一家公益企业。第三方认证则由绿色事业认证(Green Business Certification)进行——该机构还对能源与环境先导设计（Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design，简称LEED）项目进行认证——包括对水和空气样本的上门审核及实验室分析。\\n\\n根据迪洛斯的数据，35个国家的954个项目已经注册了WELL，有些经过了认证，有些受到了预先认证；其中有327个项目在美国，纽约有24个。这些项目中有一大部分都是办公室。毫无意外，迪洛斯的总部达到了要求最高的认证标准——白金级。\\n\\n迪洛斯CEO保罗·夏拉，他于2014年创办了这家公司，当时他发现了房地产与蓬勃发展的养生运动交汇处这个未经开发的市场。 Cole Wilson for The New York Times\\n\\n工作场合的设计是为了引导人们改变自己的行为。比如，为了鼓励人们多加利用，楼梯放在了前方和中间的位置。\\n\\n但在一个以促进健康为设计宗旨的办公室里，仅仅是身在其中就能获益了。例如，以24小时为周期的照明会在一天内不断变化，与日光的增强和转暗保持同步，这一举措已经被证明能够改善人们在晚间的睡眠质量。\\n\\n夏拉说：“如果我们能设计出一个盒子，我们90%的生命都在它里面度过，而它会自动提供医疗保健，那将会产生非常大的影响。”\\n\\n已经出现了为保健和健康制定的其他标准。例如，Fitwel提供了一个目标相似但来源和方法不同的认证项目。\\n\\n由疾病控制和预防中心(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)开发的Fitwel主要基于公共卫生数据，并推广已经对健康显示出最大影响的战略。\\n\\n在对总务管理局(General Services Administration)办公室的系统进行测试后，疾病控制和预防中心与纽约的一个非营利组织积极设计中心(Center for Active Design)签订了合同，以管理并更广泛地应用该项目。\\n\\n从去年开始的Fitwel基本上是一个自己动手的在线清单和评分系统。一栋建筑的所有者或管理者输入有关一个设施的信息并提交照片证据。\\n\\n“它的设计非常简单，你可以带着平板电脑在一座建筑里走动，查看清单，用平板电脑拍照并上传，”疾病控制和预防中心首席可持续发展官利兹·约克(Liz York)说。“到最后，点击一个按钮。”\\n\\n审阅者会处理这些信息，给用户一个评分和一张待办事项清单，以改善办公条件。\\n\\n迪洛斯办公室内部的咖啡馆。WELL建筑标准分为七大类，旨在促进建筑内人员的健康，分别为空气、舒适度、健身、光线、精神、营养及水。 Cole Wilson for The New York Times\\n\\n包括商业房地产公司铁狮门(Tishman Speyer)在内的一些公司是Fitwel的顾问委员会成员，这些公司正在它们进行的开发项目中应用它。\\n\\n“你可以在一栋单独的建筑中使用Fitwel，但是我们希望支持大量用户，”积极设计中心(Center for Active Design)总裁兼首席执行官乔安娜·弗兰克(Joanna Frank)说。“我们正在考虑大规模市场转型。”\\n\\nFitwel的认证费用远远低于Well。\\n\\nWell项目的注册费用为1800至4200美元，认证费用为7500至131250美元，具体视面积而定。这不包括为了把促进健康功能投入应用以获得认证所需的开支。\\n\\n此外还建议每三年重新认证一次，以确保办公室继续成为能促进健康的环境。\\n\\nFitwel收取500美元注册费和6000美元认证费。满足一些建议所需要的经费支出可能相当有限。一个建议可能是竖立通向楼梯的标志，鼓励员工走楼梯；另一种可能是为哺乳的母亲留出哺乳室或工位。\\n\\n即使在获得Fitwel的认证后，建筑管理者也还可以通过在预算允许的情况下进行额外投资来提高分数，并改善内部装修。\\n\\n这两个项目对员工健康的预期改善可以提高生产率，包括降低医疗保健成本、缺勤率以及提高员工绩效带来的收入。\\n\\n美国室内设计师协会(The American Society of Interior Designers)称，两年前搬进得到了Well认证的华盛顿总部后，该协会的生产率提高了16%。首席执行官兰迪·费瑟(Randy W. Fiser)说，该组织耗资约200万美元为办公空间配备设备，跟踪该设计的影响，并发现员工参与度有所提高，缺勤率有所降低。\\n\\n费瑟也是迪洛斯顾问委员会的成员，他说，该组织在第一年因生产力的提高和能源成本的节约而增加了近70万美元的净利润。\\n\\n然而，据与客户一起参与这些项目的建筑师和设计师所称，吸引员工的愿望似乎正在促使许多公司转向可以帮它们打造健康办公环境的项目。\\n\\n“在今天的经济里，人们可以换工作，”珀金斯威尔建筑设计事务所(Perkins & Will)建筑师兼可持续设计联席总监宝拉·麦克沃伊(Paula McEvoy)说，该公司去年完成了两个Well认证的项目和五个Fitwel认证。“他们可以选择工作的场所。\"\\n\\n由于两个认证系统做的基本上是相同的事情，一些设计师可能会有些困惑。\\n\\n但是积极设计中心的弗兰克对此不以为然。\\n\\n“我们相信市场上有两种认证系统共存的空间，”她说，并补充说，两个项目的存在可能会加强健康办公室存在意义的信息。\\n\\n她说：“越多人在谈论促进工作场所的健康越好。”',\n",
       " '1941年的一天，李吴氏（音，Lee Ng Shee）去新泽西州的布拉德利海滩(Bradley Beach)散步。她是纽约唐人街的著名商人李乐(Lee B. Lok)的妻子，1891年，李乐在勿街开了一家杂货店，名叫广源盛(Quong Yuen Shing & Co.)。这户人家夏天的时候喜欢去泽西海岸消暑，但要找到愿意把房子租给非白种人的房东可不容易。缠过足的李吴氏小心地迈着步子，经过纽瓦克大道上的一栋房子时，门廊出现了一名女子。“你在找房子吗？”她大声嚷道。“要不要买这房子？”\\n\\n李吴氏的生意嗅觉非常敏锐。花了2000美元，李家就在一个村子里有了一栋夏天可以落脚的房子，“20年前，他们若是能在某个店铺的楼上租到几间房，就要谢天谢地了，”祖上曾是华埠名流的布鲁斯・爱德华・何(Bruce Edward Hall)在他1998年关于唐人街的回忆录《茶壶烈酒》(Tea That Burns)中写道。\\n\\n李吴氏的好运气为更多的唐人街家庭来到布拉德利海滩铺平了道路，这是一个只有7个街区宽13个街区长的滨海小镇，曼哈顿唐人街开车大约100公里的距离。其他华人也跟着在同一条街上置业，没过多久，纽瓦克大道就与曼哈顿的勿街不相上下了；在泽西海岸，出现了一个迷你的中国城。他们开玩笑，称这片地区为“海边唐人街”。还有其他的前辈称这里是“中国人的里维埃拉(Chinese Riviera)”。\\n\\n李吴氏(Lee Ng Shee)。 Courtesy of Pat Lee\\n\\n对于那些经常光顾这里的唐人街华人来说，布拉德利海滩意味着宽敞的居住空间和放松；它是一个游泳、钓鱼、吃冰激凌和打麻将或者玩扑克直至深夜的地方。对于许多一大家子挤在只有一间房的公寓、得跟左邻右舍共用厕所的孩子们来说，这是他们第一次接触到城市之外的生活，在那里，一家人可能就拥有整栋房子，里面有多间卧室，有东奔西跑的空间。\\n\\n在布拉德利海滩度假，也意味着其他一些东西：它代表着某种中产阶级理想的实现，相应地，它也说明了“二战”后美国华人地位的不断变化。对于一些人来说，这是他们第一次在一个没有完全被中国人面孔包围的社区生活。这个社区兴起于美国各地的白人黑人仍然在实行种族隔离的海滩游泳、在实行种族隔离的学校上学、许多州的法律禁止异族通婚的时代。华人的地位介于两者之间：在美国的一些地方，华人既不能上黑人的学校，也不能上白人的学校；在有些地方，黑人的场所欢迎他们的加入，但被禁止进入白人的地盘（在何的回忆录中，一些唐人街的居民提到，在马里兰州，警察有一次将他们从白人的海滩驱逐出去，倒是黑人邀请他们去自己的海滩）；还有一些地方，中国人享有与白人同等的待遇。\\n\\n李吴氏在布拉德利海滩买房两年之后的1943年，美国废除了《排华法案》，该法案禁止低技术的中国人移民美国。在那个十年结束的时候，华人家庭在布拉德利拥已有了整片的住宅，美国对中国人的态度也开始从负面转向正面。\\n\\n在美国，实现进一步平等与融合的道路仍将崎岖不平；在布拉德利海滩，何写道，中国人普遍受到良好对待，但他们仍然不大愿意参与某些社区活动，像是每周在海滨步道举行的舞会。“那是给白人子弟玩的，”何的一个表亲告诉他。“我想我们只是害怕他们会取笑我们。那还不如不去呢。”但是，在新泽西海岸形成的一个海滩社区，华裔的小朋友可以怡然自得地跟犹太裔、意大利裔和其他白人孩子一起筑沙堡（尽管在相当长的一段时间里，黑人孩子还是只能去临近城镇的一处隔离海滩玩耍），至少这是一个正在取得进步的正面迹象。\\n\\n布拉德利海滩上的家庭。 Courtesy of Shirley Ayres\\n\\n李家在20世纪40年代开拓了买房之路，但唐人街家庭开始在布拉德利租房的故事，可以往前追溯至更为久远的历史。1877年，宾夕法尼亚州谢尔曼一个乡村教区的牧师要求他的会众向来自纽约的贫困儿童敞开家门。肺结核在纽约拥挤不堪的廉租公寓里流行，大家相信新鲜空气有助于治疗呼吸系统的疾病。\\n\\n这个计划大受欢迎，整个纽约城的教堂开始在夏天把教区居民送到乡间和海滨地区。“客人分为三大群体，分别是希伯来人（犹太人——译注）、意大利人和中国人；其中恐怕最有意思的，当属华人妇女和儿童，”1909年的《兴华报》(The Christian Advocate)在报道下东区一座教堂时写道。“对于所有这些人来说，男孩也好女孩也好，妈妈也好宝宝也好，夏天的时候离开下东区令人几乎无法忍受的环境，离开条件甚至更恶劣的唐人街去度个假，不啻于上帝的礼物。”\\n\\n1925年，纽约唐人街。 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY/ PUBLIC DOMAIN\\n\\n这些安排发展到后来，就成为今天大家所知道的新鲜空气基金会(Fresh Air Fund)，这是一个非营利机构，现在它仍然将数千名来自纽约低收入社区的儿童送到乡间度假。此外，是它把下曼哈顿人带到了布拉德利海滩。这种联系由万国教会(Church of All Nations)促成，这是一个卫理公会社区福利服务之家，于1923年在休斯敦街附近的第二大道9号开业。这个教会的名字就反映出一种接纳和包容的信条；所以，这里的服务语言包括波兰语、中文、俄语和英语。\\n\\n该教会在布拉德利海滩拥有一栋名为克里夫别墅(Cliff Villa)的消夏寓所。每年夏天，教会都会安排不同种族的人去那里度假，一次两三个礼拜：一批中国人，再一批意大利人，还有其他的族群，像是亚美尼亚人、斯洛伐克人、波兰人和日本人。\\n\\n“这是一个享受海滩、游戏、户外淋浴、阿斯柏里公园(Asbury Park)的夜晚、欧申格罗夫大礼堂(Ocean Grove Auditorium)的礼拜天，以及新老朋友美好回忆的时刻，”以前这儿的常客蒂姆·曾(Tim Tsang)在口述史《布拉德利海滩的珍宝》(Bradley Beach Treasures)一书中回忆；这本书记录了那些于20世纪上半叶在布拉德利海滩涌现出的各社区。去年去世的蒂姆·曾第一次来克里夫别墅是在1939年，当时他11岁，跟舅舅一起。几年之后，他在这里遇到了未来的妻子玛格丽特·秦·曾(Margaret Chin Tsang)。\\n\\n其他的来客还记得当年在纽瓦克大道上的维吉尔斯(Virgil’s)杂货店买一便士糖果和一美分鱼钩，在弗莱彻湖(Fletcher Lake)钓鱼的情景，还有每到饭点，克里夫别墅的经理乔·吉利亚(Joe Giglia)就会按铃召唤附近玩耍的小朋友回来吃饭。\\n\\n1956年前后，唐人街第23公立学校里六年级的学生。 Courtesy of Shirley Eng\\n\\n新鲜空气基金会安排的唐人街家庭非常喜欢这种体验——尤其是在空调出现前的日子，于是他们开始自己租房。到20世纪30年代末，镇上已经随处可以见到他们的身影了。然而，他们并不总是受到欢迎。据何说，邻居们有时候也会抱怨，这些人家就会搬到不太显眼的地方住下。\\n\\n出于这个原因，李家在纽瓦克达到买下第一栋房，相当于一个分水岭的时刻。不出几年，李乐的儿子、几个女儿、朋友也都先后在那里置业。\\n\\n“泽西海岸的城镇跟其他地方一样，也存在歧视。在布拉德利我们住的那片地区——不仅仅是我们，还有其他群体——是那些无法适应其他地方的人，”75岁的莫约翰(John Mok)回忆道，他是李吴氏与李乐的孙子。“我们不可能去斯普林莱克，那里是爱尔兰人的“里维埃拉”。迪尔（行政区）都是非常有钱的家庭。欧申格罗夫只有白种循道宗信徒。我们住的那片地区位于镇子的北边，那里不像南城那样受欢迎。”今天，莫约翰还住在祖父母1941年买的那栋房的同一个街区。他在勿街34号长大，几乎半个世纪前的1873年，一个名叫华记(Wah Kee)的男子开了一家卖中国货的铺子，建立起我们所知道的曼哈顿唐人街。\\n\\n在布拉德利海滩买房或租房的大多数人都跟李乐差不多，来自相对富裕的商人家庭，在美国已经生活了好几代。几乎所有的移民都是来自台山，在废除《排华法案》之前，来美国的中国移民绝大多数都是那里人。\\n\\n何（现已去世）在他的书中，描绘了他的祖父赫克·晓普(Hock Shop)——在唐人街打理着一家花店的赌注经纪人——在上世纪50年代跟家人一起度假的情形：“在阵亡将士纪念日的那个周末，大迁徙就开始了。赫克·晓普开着别克，刘大夫开着克莱斯勒，黄平卫(Pee Wee Wong)开着在他勿街的公寓前修好的各种老爷车加入到车队，穿过荷兰隧道，沿着老的9号公路来到他们的夏季飞地。似乎大家都来了，在一个个的小天地里，就像是老家农村的宅院般。何家在四街坊，李家在一街坊，其他人家都住在纽瓦克大道。”\\n\\n2002年前后，李家在布拉德利海滩的房子。 Courtesy of Shirley Ayres\\n\\n男人会把女人和孩子先送过来消暑，然后自己回到城里继续上班。周末是唐人街许多店铺生意最好的时候，因为会有很多游客下馆子、逛古玩店；而礼拜天，是很多在三州地区的洗衣房和餐馆工作的中国人休息的日子，他们会来唐人街买东西、办事、走亲访友。唐人街周日的繁忙结束后，到了周一，男人会再次跑到南边的布拉德利海滩。女人做做女红、打打麻将，而男人则玩玩牌，或者挤进一辆车去附近的蒙茅斯公园赛马场(Monmouth Park Race Track)，“可能跟马驹在一起的时间，多过去海边的时间，”何写道。孩子们会去维吉尔斯杂货店买比萨和冰淇淋，或者跑去阿斯伯里公园玩各种游戏和游乐设施。\\n\\n其他种族在布拉德利也形成了类似的社区。从20世纪40年代起，这个地区就被称为“百吉饼海滩”，因为它在纽约和新泽西的犹太人当中非常受欢迎（百吉饼是一种传统的犹太面包圈——译注）。在50年代，与纽瓦克大道一街之隔的公园广场大道，成为了意大利区，吸引了曼哈顿“小意大利”的居民。巧的是，“小意大利”毗邻曼哈顿的唐人街，因此，布拉德利的意大利人区和华人区是对纽约民族地理学的映射。\\n\\n“我的妈妈很喜欢这里，”莫约翰说起家人在布拉德利的经历。“她后来成了一名老师，所以是有暑假的，她喜欢到这儿来，因为她一直是住在公寓里。（长大后，）我们住在一个经济公寓里，卫生间在外面。”\\n\\n莫约翰的祖父有六个女儿和一个儿子，即使是在纽瓦克大道原来那栋房子，一家人住在里面也紧巴巴的。后来，他的一个阿姨在马路对面买了房。另一个阿姨跟他的母亲格蕾丝一起，在这个街区的另一个地方买了房，也就是约翰今天住的地方。\\n\\n但在之后的数十年时间里，随着对置业的种族限制及其他歧视性做法的减少，华裔在类似布拉德利海滩这样的社区扎堆的需求也减少了。今天，一个来自唐人街的家庭可以在各种海滨，跟各种人一起舒适地消夏，与此同时，构成了布拉德利的华裔房东和华裔租房者核心群体的那群人的子女，因为长大、念大学和找工作，大部分人都搬出了唐人街，散落在全美各地。\\n\\n这样一来，海边唐人街的规模就缩小了。\\n\\n布拉德利海滩上的麻将。

Lum\\n\\n李乐创立的那家店铺于2003年关门。2005年，位于第二大道的万国教会被拆除，现在原址矗立着一幢12层的公寓楼。在布拉德利，克里夫别墅在1965年被烧毁，现在一条马路穿过了从这栋房子到弗莱彻湖之间从前的一片开阔地。李家在纽瓦克大道原来的房子已经换了主人。现在，还记得“百吉饼海滩”或者“海边唐人街”这些绰号的人，大多上了年纪。不过，布拉德利海滩依旧很受欢迎，全年人口为5000人，夏季人口会增加到3万人。\\n\\n许多海边唐人街先驱者的孩子，以及他们孩子的孩子，仍然会来这里。莫约翰估计，大约有15到20个源自唐人街的家庭，今天仍在布拉德利海滩拥有住房；他说，在五六十年代这个社区的全盛时期，他自己的亲朋好友可能就为社区贡献了100名成员。莫约翰的姐姐还住在他家隔壁。他的妻子卢埃拉小时候被教会多次送去过克里夫别墅，她有五户亲戚住在布拉德利海滩。莫约翰来自唐人街的两个儿时玩伴——他们相识于幼儿园，也都在这个社区买了房。\\n\\n“如今，孙子辈是我们在布拉德利保留住房的原因，”已故的蒂姆·曾在他的口述史中强调。“我来自加州的孙辈们很快就要来了，他们的妈妈可以让他们领略她所知道的布拉德利……这是通向快乐时光的一个共同的纽带。”',\n",
       " '申请文书至关重要，因为对你心仪的学校来说，录取或拒绝你常常取决于申请文书上的差别，这里集合了一些文书写作专家的建议。\\n\\n申请文书就是你的话筒——它传递着你的世界观与抱负。它不仅仅是一封简历，或是对你已经做过的事情的回顾。它需要你满怀热情地去讲述一个故事，用个性化的、有意思的趣闻来展现你的性格、你的兴趣、你的价值观、你的生活经历、你对世界的看法 、你的抱负，甚至是你的幽默感。\\n\\n强调你所做过的志愿服务工作，或是你帮助过他人或让你所在的社区变得更好的其他做法。如果你想要学习的学科与此相关，那么这些经历将大有帮助。举个例子，克里斯多夫·里姆(Christopher Rim)是教育咨询机构指挥教育集团(Command Education Group)的一员，他记得一名想要成为牙医的学生曾经创办了一个非营利组织，并组织募捐者向给流浪者收容机构发放牙刷、牙膏及其他牙科产品。录取招生官们想知道的是，你的出现将如何把学校变得更好。\\n\\n提及的实习经历，暑期课程、课外活动或是实验室工作，以展现你为学习和理解自己感兴趣的领域所做出的努力。这样有助于展现你了解自己所选择学习的领域，并对此充满热情。\\n\\n用学识和热情解释你为什么想在这所学校、而非其他学校学习。讲出为什么这所学校的规模、课程、社交氛围、地理位置、教授或是历史影响了你的选择。\\n\\n正确的拼写、语法和标点非常关键。使用具有一定复杂程度的语法、结构和措辞能展现出你为上大学做好了准备。千万不要用短信风格的缩写，或是粗鲁低俗的语言。\\n\\n在文书提交以后，每天查看你的邮件及语音信箱，确保你看到并及时回复录取招生官们发来的信息。很多学生只查看短信，而且有时会错过那些询问后续问题或邀请面试的邮件。\\n\\n拉卡尼教育咨询机构(Lakhani Coaching)的哈菲兹·拉卡尼(Hafeez Lakhani)这样总结申请文书：“每所大学就像是一张餐桌。什么能够使你成为餐桌交谈中最有趣的贡献者？什么能够使你让其他每个人都获得更有趣的体验？”一篇充满趣闻轶事与个性色彩的好文书将会回答那些问题，并从人群中脱颖而出。',\n",
       " '当被问到他们为什么辞掉了白领工作，踏上自行车周游世界之旅时，这对年轻的美国情侣给出了一个简单的解释：他们厌倦了开会、电话会议、时间表和密码更改。\\n\\n“在这个巨大的、美丽的世界里，有一种魔力，”杰伊·奥斯汀(Jay Austin)写道，他和伴侣劳伦·盖根(Lauren Geoghegan)去年提前两周申请了离职，然后把他的自行车寄去了非洲。\\n\\n事实时常证明他们是正确的。\\n\\n当然也有艰苦，包括轮胎被刺破、狂吠的狗、寒冷冰雹以及疾病。但是对于同为29岁的奥斯汀和盖根来说，人与人之间产生联系的时刻远远盖过了这些。\\n\\n决定环游世界时，奥斯汀还在为美国住房和城市发展部工作。 Simplycycling.org\\n\\n两天后，伊斯兰国发布了一段视频，显示了坐在ISIS旗帜前的五名被其确认为袭击者的男子。他们面对镜头发誓：杀死“不信者”。\\n\\n在乔治城大学(Georgetown University)获得硕士学位后，他开始在美国住房和城市发展部(Department of Housing and Urban Development)工作。他儿时的朋友阿什莉·奥泽里(Ashley Ozery)说，他确信人们积攒的许多财产都是不必要的，于是开始采用极简主义的生活方式。\\n\\n他亲手建造了一栋房子，绰号“火柴盒”，它很小——只有140平方英尺——以至于被许多电视节目介绍过。为了挪出空间，墙壁里嵌入了磁铁，这样他就可以把金属物品粘在镶板上，比如他收集的香料。\\n\\n这对情侣在旅途中沿路露营。 Simplycycling.org\\n\\n如果他的目标之一是把生活缩减到最基本的程度，另一个目标就是扩大他的世界。因为他没有抵押贷款，所以他的迷你房子意味着他可以从这份政府工作中休无薪假期，环游世界。\\n\\n“在住房和城市发展部，每年年底你可以要求更高的工资或更多的假期，”奥泽里说。“他总是选择更多的假期。”\\n\\n奥泽里说他一开始在美国骑踏板摩托车旅行。随后在欧洲进行了一次铁路旅行。接下来是在纳米比亚待了一段时间。接着是一次为期一周的印度之旅。她是1999年在新泽西州麦纳拉潘的小学与奥斯汀成为朋友的。\\n\\n2012年，奥斯汀遇见了劳伦·安·盖根，一名南加州本地人，她和他一样毕业于乔治城大学，现在学校的招生办公室工作。\\n\\n“打破常规。”“挑战我，让我成长。”“有冒险精神。”盖根是这样向她最亲密的朋友描述奥斯汀的，从在乔治城大学的第一年就认识盖根的克里斯汀·鲍兹·罗宾逊(Kristen Bautz Robinson)说。\\n\\n虽然盖根也是一位经验丰富的旅行者——她在贝鲁特度待了一个夏天学习阿拉伯语，在马德里度过的一个学期让她学会了一口流利的西班牙语——但奥斯汀特有的粗糙、自己动手式的旅行对她来说很新鲜。\\n\\n奥斯汀和盖根用照片和写作记录了他们的旅程。 Simplycycling.org\\n\\n盖根的朋友说，奥斯汀的价值观开始影响她。她买了一张自行车共享日间通票，然后成了年费会员。又过了一阵她已经买了自己的自行车。\\n\\n奥斯汀是个纯素食者。盖根成为了素食主义者，她的密友阿曼达·凯利甘(Amanda Kerrigan)说。\\n\\n正是在2016年，盖根告诉凯利甘，她计划辞去工作，骑自行车环游世界。凯利甘抑制不住一丝担忧。“我说，‘这不是我认识的劳伦，’”她补充道：“杰伊改变了劳伦的生活轨道。”\\n\\n盖根和凯利甘告别的那天，两个朋友在盖根的公寓外拥抱。\\n\\n“一旦直觉告诉你什么地方不对劲，那就赶紧离开，”凯利甘告诉她。她关心自己的朋友，一是因为盖根的慷慨善良，二是因为，她担心奥斯汀对危险比盖根更不敏感。\\n\\n他们的旅行是一系列对身体的繁重考验，偶尔也很艰苦，不时穿插着人性的善意。\\n\\n但在旅行过程中，他们的博客文章也偶尔提到了一些残酷行为。\\n\\n在一个山口，一群人挡住他们的路，试图将这对恋人从车上推下来。\\n\\n阿拉木图一家酒店房间里晾晒衣服。 Simplycycling.org\\n\\n在距离西班牙边境仅有50码的一处拥堵路段，奥斯汀向一个司机打手势，表示想并入他的车道。司机让他进来了，然后故意在后面慢慢逼近，把奥斯汀的车困在他的车和前面的车辆之间。\\n\\n不过，当他们在一个多星期前到达塔吉克斯坦公路的那个弯道时，他们已经有了这样一个观念：世界是非常美好的，几十张带图说的照片和他们留下的几千字的文章表明了这一点。\\n\\n“从报纸上看你会相信这个世界是个又大又可怕的地方，”奥斯汀写道。“那些文章说，人们不值得信任。人们很糟糕。人们是邪恶的。”\\n\\n“我不相信。邪恶是我们发明出来的一种虚构的概念，用来应付那些持与我们不同的价值观、信仰和观点的人类的复杂性……总的来说，人类是善良的。有时自私，有时短视，但他们是善良的。他们慷慨、美好而且善良。”\\n\\n“这是我们在旅程中获得的最大启示，”他写道。\\n\\n这对情侣去世后，在伊斯兰国发布的视频中，可以看到那些宣誓效忠该组织的人们坐在一块石板上，越过他们的左肩可以远远地看见一片湛蓝的湖泊。这对年轻情侣本可能会停下来给它拍照，并且发布在他们的博客上。\\n\\n奥斯汀和盖根相识于华盛顿。 Simplycycling.org\\n\\n但这段视频中，这些人指点着周围的风景，发誓要杀死那些踏上他们的土地的“不信者”。',\n",
       " '香港——住在中国南方城市柳州的韦迪泷今年18岁，喜欢篮球、嘻哈音乐和好莱坞超级英雄电影。他计划2020年上大学时，去加拿大念化学。\\n\\n在另一方面，韦迪泷也是一个典型的中国青少年：他从没听说过谷歌(Google)或Twitter。不过，他倒是听说过Facebook。“好像是和百度差不多？”最近的一个下午他问道。他说的百度是中国主要的搜索引擎。\\n\\n现在，与这个不同的互联网体系成长起来的影响开始显现。许多中国年轻人不知道谷歌、Twitter或是Facebook是什么，这在他们与世界其他地方之间造成了一道鸿沟。而且，由于习惯了本土应用程序和在线服务，许多人似乎对了解网上什么内容遭到了审查无甚关心，这让北京得以建立起一套与西方自由民主制度竞争的替代价值体系。\\n\\n即使西方应用程序和网站能进入中国，他们也可能会在年轻人那里遭到冷遇。\\n\\n经过18个月的调查研究后，北京大学和斯坦福大学两名经济学家今年得出了结论，中国大学生对于获取未经审查的政治敏感信息漠不关心。他们给北京两所大学的近1000名学生提供了能够绕过审查的免费工具，但发现近半数学生并没有使用它。在那些使用了的学生中，几乎没人花时间浏览遭到屏蔽的外国新闻网站。\\n\\n23岁的张叶琼在中国辛集工作，她在谈起中国本土的搜索引擎时说，“我长大时一直用百度，习惯了。” Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times\\n\\n学者们写道：“我们的发现表明，审查制度在中国是有效的，不仅因为该制度使得敏感信息难以获取，还因为它营造了一种环境，让民众首先不要求获取这些信息。”\\n\\n现年23岁、在距离北京几个小时车程的小城市辛集一家电子商务公司做客服代表的张叶琼也表达了这种观点。“我长大时一直用百度，习惯了，”她说。\\n\\n这种态度甚至不同于80年代出生在中国的人。大约十年前这一代人成年时，还有一些不驯服的人。其中最著名的是韩寒，一位质疑中国政治制度和传统价值观的博客作者。他的书销量数以百万计，在中国的Twitter——新浪微博上拥有4000多万粉丝。\\n\\n相反，许多中国年轻人使用如百度、社交媒体服务微信和短视频平台抖音这样的应用和服务。他们时常赞颂消费主义和民族主义。\\n\\n今年3月，社交媒体巨头腾讯进行了一项调查，包括了一万多名出生于2000年或之后的用户，近八成的人表示，他们认为中国要么正处于历史上最好的时期，要么每天都在变成一个更好的国家。几乎相同比例的人表示，他们对自己的未来感到非常乐观或比较乐观。\\n\\n把自己描述为爱国、乐观、外向的人之中包括沈亚楠。28岁的她在保定一个房地产网站的运营部门工作，保定是北京附近一个约有300万人口的城市。她认为中国是一个伟大的国家，并说她将尽她最大的努力使它更加强大。\\n\\n每天晚上，她都会用手机看一到两个小时的韩国肥皂剧。她说，她的智能手机上没有任何新闻应用程序，因为她对政治不感兴趣。她去过日本几次，在那里使用过谷歌地图，但是没有访问任何被中国屏蔽的外国网站。\\n\\n“国内的app什么都有，”她说。\\n\\n“国内的app什么都有，”28岁的沈亚楠说，她在中国保定工作，对政治不感兴趣。 Gilles Sabrié for The New York Times\\n\\n14岁的文圣坚想成为一名说唱歌手，他崇拜德雷克(Drake)和坎耶·韦斯特(Kanye West)。他的家人在7月从北京搬到了山东省东部的石油城东营，他说他注意到美国说唱歌手对社会问题非常直言不讳，有些人甚至在音乐中批评了总统。\\n\\n他说，这在中国行不通，因为它是一个发展中国家，需要保持社会稳定。这是共产党确保国家媒体和学校教科书不断重复的一句话。\\n\\n喜欢打篮球的文圣坚说，他知道谷歌、Facebook、Twitter和Instagram这些网站的名字。他说，他父亲的一个朋友告诉他，这些网站被屏蔽是因为其中一些内容“不适合中国特色社会主义的发展”。\\n\\n“我不需要它们，”他说。\\n\\n当中国年轻人在国外的时候，许多人不得不学习一种完全不同的互联网生态系统。23岁的方佩瑞（音）就是这样，他两年前从中国南方的广州来到澳大利亚悉尼学习市场营销。在悉尼，他了解了全新的一系列网站，包括谷歌、Facebook、YouTube和Snapchat。\\n\\n他说，现在假期回到中国看望家人时，没法用谷歌会让他感到烦恼。他也学会了不要在父母面前查看敏感的政治新闻，因为他曾因这样做被父母责备。\\n\\n“中国的软件一出国就没用了，”他说。但是对于谷歌和其他应用来说，“国际的软件无论去到哪个国家，用的都是这些软件，”他还说。“投资回报率非常高。”',\n",

       " '韩国首尔——2016年4月6日凌晨1点20分左右，一架飞往马来西亚吉隆坡的亚航航班准备从上海起飞。机上一名叫许姜日（Heo Kang-il，音）的朝鲜男子，在手机上拨通了一个熟悉的号码，把讯息传达出去。\\n\\n“我能听到电话另一头爆发出的欢呼声和掌声，”许姜日说。“他们说我是英雄。”\\n\\n韩方官员表示，这些女性在中国生活期间开始渴望脱北，她们在那里看到了韩国的影视作品。但最近几个月，这种说法开始变得漏洞百出。\\n\\n今年5月，许姜日和几名女服务员告诉一个新闻频道，他知道目的地是韩国，但那些女性都蒙在鼓里。他说，那次脱北行动是由韩国的国家情报院(National Intelligence Service)策划的。\\n\\n韩国的人权委员会于本周开始对绑架指控展开调查。\\n\\n负责韩朝关系的韩国统一部部长赵明均最近重申，韩国政府相信这些女性是自愿来韩国的，不过他也表示，该信息来自情报部门。\\n\\n现在，许姜日在接受《纽约时报》的一系列采访中，透露了更多导致脱北的原因。他的说法大多无法证实，而韩国情报机构以检察官正在调查为由拒绝讨论——他所讲述的是一个关于谎言、勒索和不断被背叛的故事。\\n\\n“他们都是说谎大王和骗子手，”许姜日在谈到韩国间谍时说。他现在认为，韩国间谍利用并抛弃了他。“我希望能让时光倒流。”\\n\\n许姜日和女服务员们最初是在中国东北靠近朝鲜边境的城市延吉工作。 Yan Cong for The New York Times\\n\\n尽心尽力为党工作\\n\\n朝鲜派他到中国东北城市延吉经营一家餐馆。这家餐厅的女服务员都来自朝鲜，她们同时也是音乐人，朝鲜因为核武器计划受到制裁，遭到孤立，这些餐馆是平壤政府的一个外汇来源。\\n\\n只有得到政府信任的朝鲜人，才能在这些餐馆里工作，许姜日显然是其中之一。他出身在一个颇有来头的朝鲜家庭，29岁就加入了执政的劳动党。\\n\\n2013年，他和他招募并培训的22名朝鲜女性前往延吉。他的任务是每年为朝鲜政权带去10万美元。\\n\\n“中国餐厅老板喜欢我们的工人，因为他们很便宜，而且工作时有着军事化的纪律，”许姜日说。这家餐馆的老板是中国人，但许姜日负责管理工作人员。\\n\\n尽管他们身处朝鲜专制国家的边界之外，政府的耳目还是无处不在。许姜日说，他受到朝鲜特工监控，他们开始向他施加影响，要求过高的贿赂。\\n\\n许姜日说，在中国的岁月里，这些要求只是压力之一。他还开始听说在朝鲜的朋友被送进监狱，卷进清洗行动。\\n\\n他说他开始对自己国家的制度不抱幻想，并且开始对韩国感兴趣。他说他开始产生为韩国工作，最终实现朝韩统一的梦想。\\n\\n换边站\\n\\n他说，2014年的一天，他开始接触这家餐馆的一位常客，这名朝鲜族的中国人似乎认识一群有趣的人。他说，他小心翼翼地问那人是否认识在韩国情报部门工作的人。\\n\\n这个联系人让他与一名男子保持联系，经过一系列对话后，该男子自称为国家情报局官员。许姜日说，2015年，他开始向那名官员提供有关朝鲜导弹和潜艇计划的信息，这些都是他从朝鲜上层中的朋友那里获得的。他还签署了向韩国效忠的保证书。\\n\\n他说，这样的往来持续了数月。然后出现了一个意想不到的麻烦。那个顾客告诉许姜日，他知道许姜日的间谍活动，并且要求10万美元的封口费。\\n\\n他不断向许姜日提出这个要求，为了逃开他，许姜日只能将女服务员们转移到上海附近的宁波市，到另一家餐馆工作。但他说，那个顾客也出现在了宁波。\\n\\n他的暴露似乎只是时间问题。2016年初，他开始恳求韩国情报官员帮助他去韩国。他们讨论了在5月30日采取行动。\\n\\n但是在4月3日，许姜日说那名官员突然告诉他，要在48小时内离开，并带走当时为他工作的所有19名女性。\\n\\n许姜日说，他对此犹豫不决，但该官员威胁要亲手向朝鲜人揭发他。根据许姜日的说法，那名官员承诺，如果他照办，将会获得相当于数百万美元的报酬。\\n\\n许姜日表示，这个闭路电视画面中右边是他，左边那人是一名韩国情报官员。 Heo Kang-li\\n\\n最后，根据许姜日的说法，这位官员承诺韩国将对该事件保持沉默，保护脱北者在朝鲜的家人免受政府报复。\\n\\n离开中国\\n\\n许姜日说，他买了20张去吉隆坡的夜航机票，告诉女服务员们准备再次搬家，但他没有说要去哪里。计划是先将她们带到马来西亚，然后再到首尔。\\n\\n很快就出了问题。在他们离开前几个小时，五名女服务员在休息时间消失了。许姜日担心她们是去找朝鲜特工，于是用五辆出租车将其他14名女人匆匆送往上海机场。\\n\\n但是餐厅老板意识到发生了什么，感到非常愤怒，显然是因为他可能会失去自己的投资，许姜日说，他开着自己的车追赶她们，并且撞上了一辆出租车，许姜日说。那辆出租车里的两个女人被留下了。\\n\\n飞机降落在吉隆坡之后，许姜日再次让女人们乘坐出租车，最后在韩国大使馆停了下来。\\n\\n他说，当女人们看到韩国国旗时，感到非常震惊。\\n\\n“我们只被告知我们要搬去一家新餐馆，”其中一个女人在5月对韩国广播公司JTBC表示。（该电视台隐瞒了这些女人的的身份，她们表示担心家人安全。）\\n\\n许姜日说，他告诉这些女人，已经没有回头路了。\\n\\n“如果回到朝鲜，我们无论如何都会死，”许姜日说他这样告诉她们。他还说，韩国承诺通过对这次叛逃保密，以此保护她们的家庭。\\n\\n他们进了大使馆。他说，那天晚上，10辆武装护送的黑色SUV带着这群人直接驶向吉隆坡机场的停机坪上一架大韩航空的客机。第二天早上，飞机降落在韩国。\\n\\n当脱北者进入韩国时，第一步就是接受国家情报局详细盘问，这可能需要数周甚至数月。到达后的那天早晨，女服务员们在首尔以南的特工盘查中心看到她们上了电视。\\n\\n政府不但没有隐瞒这次脱北时间，而且还全世界宣布。许姜日说，所有女人都哭了。\\n\\n许姜日现在认为，政府选择了这次脱北的时机，以便在几天后的韩国议会选举中以获得保守派支持。\\n\\n许姜日没有收到承诺给他的数百万美元。他说，间谍机构总共为他的工作支付了3.55万美元。后来他曾在便利店担任收银员，开过送货卡车。\\n\\n他说，他在朝鲜的父母和姊妹已经失踪。']"
